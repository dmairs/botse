This class ability may be triggered according to its text's timing, either during a unit's turn or outside battle. If another ability or game effect would be resolved, the interrupt ability is resolved first. If 2 interrupt abilities would be resolved at the same time, the party decides which ability is resolved first. 

Interrupt abilities may only be triggered once per timing.
