Battles are divided into rounds. During a round, each [adventurer](/docs/all/glossary/adventurer) takes a [turn](/docs/all/glossary/turn). After your party has finished its turns, each [enemy](/docs/all/glossary/enemy) takes its own turn. 
After all [units](/docs/all/glossary/unit) have completed a single turn, the round ends. Rounds continue until your party has achieved its objective, [retreated](/docs/all/glossary/retreat), or been [defeated](/docs/all/glossary/defeated).

## Round Sequence
1.  **Start of Round:** 
    - Increase the Round Counter die by 1 (**Important**: skip this during the first round of a battle). 
    - Trigger any abilities with this timing.
    - After Round 5, set the Round Counter to the fatigue round icon (<img src="/icons/fatigue.svg" alt="Fatigue Icon" class="icon-svg" />). This is a fatigue round; unless the Round Counter is reduced to 5 or lower, each subsequent round is a fatigue round until the end of the battle. For any effect that depends on the round number, all fatigue rounds are considered to be Round 6. At the start of fatigue round each adventurer will suffer [fatigue damage](/docs/all/glossary/fatigue-damage).
2.  **Adventurer Turns:** Each [adventurer](/docs/all/glossary/adventurer) takes their [turn](/docs/all/glossary/turn), starting with the first player and continuing clockwise around the table until each adventurer has taken 1 turn.
3.  **Companion Turns**: If the party has [companion](/docs/all/glossary/companion) units, each companion takes a [turn](/docs/all/glossary/turn) in the order of the party’s choosing. See: [Companion Turns](/docs/all/glossary/companion#companion-turns)
    - **Undeployed Companions**: If a [companion](/docs/all/glossary/companion) was not deployed at the start of battle and there is an unoccupied hex on the entrance tile, deploy that companion when it would take its turn.
4.  **Enemy Turns**: Each enemy on the battle map takes a [turn](/docs/all/glossary/turn), starting with the highest-level enemy and working downwards in level until all enemies have taken a turn. If multiple enemies have the same level, the party decides in which order those enemies take their turns􀀀.
5.  **End of Round:** Trigger any effects that occur with this timing􀀀
    - Determine whether the encounter is complete; if it is, the battle ends.
    - The party may [retreat](/docs/all/glossary/retreat) and end the encounter at this time.
