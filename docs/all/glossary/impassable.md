title: Impassable
hoverText: "A battle map hex is impassable when a rule specifies that it is or contains an obstacle that is impassable, such as another tile used as an obstacle. Red hexes shown in clash or dungeon setup diagrams are impassable hexes. Place a facedown tile of the same shape as the red area over these hexes during setup to indicate this Impassable hexes cannot contain chips. If a hex that contains a chip becomes impassable, remove that chip and place it in the closest unoccupied hex."

Red hexes shown in clash or dungeon setup diagrams are impassable hexes. Place a facedown tile of the same shape as the red area over these hexes during setup to indicate this Impassable hexes cannot contain chips. If a hex that contains a chip becomes impassable, remove that chip and place it in the closest unoccupied hex.
