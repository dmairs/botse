A companion is a unit that is under the ongoing control of either the entire [party](/docs/all/glossary/party) or a specific [adventurer](/docs/all/glossary/adventurer). Companion units can be gained through encounter text or adventurer abilities. It is possible for enemy chips and quest units to become companions.

While a companion unit is part of the party, it follows these rules:

- The companion is a [party member](/docs/all/glossary/party) but not an [adventurer](/docs/all/glossary/adventurer). It is not affected by abilities that apply to adventurers, and is not counted toward the party's total number of adventurers for purposes of [party size (<img src="/icons/party-size.svg" alt="Party Size Icon" class="icon-svg" />)](/docs/all/glossary/party-size).
- The companion unit begins each battle at its maximum HP unless otherwise stated.
- If a companion is defeated, it is removed from the party permanently. Otherwise, a companion remains with the [adventurer](/docs/all/glossary/adventurer) or [party](/docs/all/glossary/party) unless it is removed by another effect.
- A defeated companion's chip is placed with other undeployed chips of its type. For example, an enemy chip that has become a companion is placed back in the correct enemy bag when defeated.
- If the companion's controlling [adventurer](/docs/all/glossary/adventurer) is defeated, the companion remains in play and that adventurer's player continues to control the companion.
- If all [adventurers](/docs/all/glossary/adventurer) are defeated, the encounter ends and all remaining companions are removed from the battle map. These companions are not treated as defeated for determining if they are removed from the [party](/docs/all/glossary/party).

## Companion Turns

Companions take their turns immediately after all of the adventurers have taken their turns. The [party](/docs/all/glossary/party) decides the order in which companions take their turns. If a companion is described as being controlled by the party, the party decides which player controls that companion during its turn.

During its turn, a companion typically moves, resolves its skills, and engages as described in the sequence below. Refer to the effect designating that unit as a companion for any additional rules.

### Companion Turn Sequence

The player controlling a companion makes the decisions for that unit during each step below. Moving and engaging are optional.

1.  **Start of Turn:** Trigger any abilities with this timing, such as [status effects](/docs/all/status-effects/) or skill dice on the companion.
2.  **Move:** You may move the companion up to 2 hexes. The companion can be moved as chosen and does not follow normal enemy movement priorities.
3.  **Engage:** The companion may engage opposing units, if able, following these substeps in the order below.
    - **Determine Target(s):** Refer to the companion's range and target icons, and choose which unit(s) the companion targets. Only [targetable](/docs/all/glossary/targetable) units in [sight](/docs/all/glossary/sight) and in [range](/docs/all/glossary/range) can be chosen. A companion's targeting priority icon is ignored.
    - **Gather and Roll Dice:** Roll all of the companion's Combat dice. A companion rolls enemy Combat dice. If the companion can engage multiple targets in range, you roll its engage once and resolve the roll against each chosen target during the next substep.
    - **Resolve the Roll:** Resolve the total rolled Combat dice value against each of the companion's targets.
    - **Units React:** [Adventurers](/docs/all/glossary/adventurer), companions, or other [enemies](/docs/all/glossary/enemy) may resolve abilities that are triggered after this companion's engage. Enemies must resolve these abilities, if able.
4.  **End of Turn:** Trigger any abilities with this timing. Then, if there are other companions, the next companion takes its turn.

### Companion Skills

Most companions have 1 or more skills from the [Enemy Skills](/docs/category/enemy-skills/) Reference. Unlike moving and engaging, resolving a companion's skills is not optional; each skill must be resolved at its specified timing (if able). If a companion engages multiple targets, each target is affected by each of the companion's relevant skills.
