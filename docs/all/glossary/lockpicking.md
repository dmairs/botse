[Adventurers](/docs/all/glossary/adventurer) frequently need to pick locks in order to open [caches](/docs/all/glossary/cache) or disarm [traps](/docs/all/glossary/trap). To do so, the adventurer makes a lockpick check against the mechanism's difficulty code. If they succeed, they pick the lock or disarm the trap, even if in the middle of an action. If they fail, that lock remains in place or the trap's effect is tripped.

During a battle, a lockpick check can be made when an [adventurer](/docs/all/glossary/adventurer) moves into a hex with a [cache](/docs/all/glossary/cache) or [trap](/docs/all/glossary/trap), even if in the middle of an action. During a town or peaceful encounter, a lockpick check can be made only when the encounter's text describes it.

## Difficulty Codes

A difficulty code has the following elements, shown on the backs of item cards and within the trap effect text of delve cards.

-

### Attempts

The number of times an [adventurer](/docs/all/glossary/adventurer) may roll the lockpick dice (3 D6) during a lockpick check while trying to match the required results.

The maximum number of lockpick attempts for an item is the top number on the back of the item card.

The maximum number of trap lockpick attempts is shown as text in parentheses.

### Digits

3 or more digits, each of which the adventurer must match to succeed at their check.

- Each digit has a value of 1–6.
- **Key Digit:** Each digit with a spiked border is a key digit and must be matched first, before the [adventurer](/docs/all/glossary/adventurer) can attempt to match other digit. Key digits are typically only found on legendary items.

## Lockpick Sequence

1. **Roll:** Gather and roll your chosen number of lockpick dice.
   - If this is your first attempt, you must roll all 3 lockpick dice.
   - During additional attempts, you may choose to keep 1 or more results from your previous attempt by setting those dice aside. These dice are not rolled during additional attempts.
   - If there is a key digit (shown in a spiked border), you must keep a die matching that digit before you may keep any other dice. However, you can decide to keep other dice rolled in the same attempt after deciding to keep a die matching the key digit. After you have kept the die matching the key digit and resolved that attempt, you may then roll that die during additional attempts as normal.
2. **Adjust Results:** You may change die results by gaining light [fatigue](/docs/all/glossary/fatigue) For each light fatigue gained, you may change 1 die result by 1, rotating that die to either [increase or decrease](/docs/all/glossary/increase-or-reduce) its result (you cannot rotate a 6 to a 1 or vice versa).
3. **Resolve the Attempt:** Compare your results to the difficulty code.
   - If your accumulated results match each digit of the code, you succeed at the check.
   - If your results do not match each digit, you fail this attempt, but you may continue to roll until you have no remaining attempts.
   - If you fail an attempt and have no remaining attempts or choose not to continue rolling, the check is failed and all die results accumulated for that check are lost.

After the lockpick check is resolved, you resume your turn in your current encounter.
