An effect that refers to healing a unit allows it to recover the specified amount of HP chips. A unit cannot heal in excess of its [Health](/docs/all/stats/health) stat.

When a party member resolves an effect that heals another party member unit for a number of HP, the unit resolving the effect chooses the amount of HP that is actually healed. This amount may be equal to or less than the number specified by the effect (to a minimum of 0). This is also true for an effect that causes an adventurer to gain an amount of [bonus HP](/docs/all/other/bonus-hp).
