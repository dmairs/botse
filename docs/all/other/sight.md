Some actions and abilities require that the unit resolving them has sight to another unit or a hex on the battle map. A unit has sight to another unit (or hex) if both units are in hexes on the same tile or an adjacent tile. 

For example, in a clash battle, an adventurer on the entrance tile has sight to an enemy on the clash tile or the entrance tile. 

A unit is always in sight of itself.
