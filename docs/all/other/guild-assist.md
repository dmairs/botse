**Once per campaign**, the party may trigger its guild assist, either during a battle at the end of a round or during the End of Day Phase's Adventurers Rest step. A guild assist can be triggered only during Sessions 1 or 2 and cannot be triggered during the Session 3 endgame quest.

When this ability is triggered, each adventurer (including defeated adventurers) immediately:

-  Heals to their full HP.
-  Removes all light [fatigue](/docs/all/other/fatigue), overfatigue, and status dice from their cooldown track.
-  May recover any number of exhausted and drained skill dice. 
-  Draws 1 <img src="/icons/legendary-item.svg" alt="Legandary Item Icon" class="icon-svg" /> and 1 <img src="/icons/common-item.svg" alt="Common Item Icon" class="icon-svg" />, gaining both (following normal inventory restrictions). 

Additionally, the party gains the benefits below depending on when they triggered their guild assist.

### During Battle
The party may set the Round Counter to any number it wishes, and defeated adventurers who are revived are deployed to any unoccupied hex.

### During End of Day Phase
The party may immediately move its party token up to 6 hexes on the overland map.

After the ability is resolved, the party must add the keyword "Guild Assist" in its campaign journal's Major Keywords field for this session. After doing so, it cannot gain the keyword from its guild quest for this session.
