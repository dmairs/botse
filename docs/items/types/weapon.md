Weapon items provide advantages in battle, often interacting with skills. Each <img src="/icons/weapon.svg" alt="Weapon Icon" class="icon-svg" /> has a standard ability that is resolved as part of an [adventurer's](/docs/glossary/adventurer) [engage](/docs/battles/adventurer-turn/engage). However, each <img src="/icons/weapon.svg" alt="Weapon Icon" class="icon-svg" /> also has a secondary, [overtax](/docs/items/overtax) keyword ability that can be triggered in addition to the item's standard ability when using the <img src="/icons/weapon.svg" alt="Weapon Icon" class="icon-svg" /> to engage. An adventurer can use only 1 <img src="/icons/weapon.svg" alt="Weapon Icon" class="icon-svg" /> per engage and must choose whether to use a <img src="/icons/weapon.svg" alt="Weapon Icon" class="icon-svg" /> effect, including its overtax effect, before their dice are rolled.
