title: Overtax
hoverText: When you trigger an item's standard ability, you may also choose to trigger its overtax ability (but cannot trigger the overtax ability without triggering the item's standard ability). If you do, after the [engage](/docs/glossary/engage) and both item abilities are resolved, that item must be [discarded](/docs/glossary/discard).

This appears as a sub-header on an [item's](/docs/items/) secondary ability, typically on [<img src="/icons/armor.svg" alt="Armor Icon" class="icon-svg" />](/docs/items/types/armor) or [<img src="/icons/weapon.svg" alt="Weapon Icon" class="icon-svg" />](/docs/items/types/weapon) items. When you trigger an item's standard ability, you may also choose to trigger its overtax ability (but cannot trigger the overtax ability without triggering the item's standard ability). If you do, after the [engage](/docs/glossary/engage) and both item abilities are resolved, that item must be [discarded](/docs/glossary/discard).
