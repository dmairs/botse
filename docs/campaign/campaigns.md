hoverText: A campaign takes place across 3 game sessions.
---

The Elder Scrolls: Betrayal of the Second Era is best played as a campaign taking place across 3 game sessions. A session ends after the party either succeeds or fails at its [guild](/docs/campaign/guilds/) quest. The rules for connecting these sessions together are explained below.

## Campaign Journal

As the [party](/docs/glossary/party) proceeds through the campaign, it uses its campaign journal to write down information that cannot be tracked on the adventurers' mats. The journal records each session's events on a single sheet for reference later, especially at the start of future sessions.

Journal sheets are provided on the included pad or can be printed from the [Chip Theory Games website](https://chiptheorygames.com/support).

## Successfully completing a Session

During the day the party succeeds at its guild quest, the players complete the [Reward Phase](/docs/campaign/day/reward-phase) but skip the [End of Day Phase](/docs/campaign/day/end-of-day-phase). Then, the session ends.

When your party completes a campaign session, the players need to record their progress and store their adventurers following the steps below. Do this before packing up the other components. Follow these instructions even if proceeding directly to the next game session.

1. The party reads its guild quest's epilogue step. This step wraps up the story of the current session's quest and gives the party instructions for choosing the [province](/docs/campaign/provinces/) and quest for its next session. These instructions vary based on which session the party just completed.
   - **Session 1:** Choose 1 of the available guild quest options from this session's epilogue. Note this choice in the party's campaign journal in the Session 2 Quest section; this will determine the province map and gazetteer used in the next session.
   - **Session 2:** Read the Session 2-specific lore text that introduces the endgame in Session 3. The endgame always takes place in the same province as Session 2.
2. The party leader records any other relevant session information, including the party's [XP](/docs/glossary/xp) Dial value, in the campaign journal.
   - All of the party's uncompleted side quests must be discarded.
   - [Discard](/docs/glossary/discard) all set-aside cards with persistent effects on them (such as overland cards), and cross out all persistent effects logged in the campaign journal. Persistent effects last only for the session in which they are gained unless specifically stated otherwise.
3. Each adventurer does the following:
   - Return all of your adventurer's HP chips, including [bonus HP](/docs/glossary/bonus-hp), to the supply. Adventurers will start the next session healed to full HP and with no bonus HP. [Recover](/docs/glossary/recover) all skill dice and discard all [fatigue](/docs/glossary/fatigue) or status dice from your [cooldown track](/docs/glossary/cooldown-track).
   - Keep your saved XP and [Cooldown](/docs/adventurer/stats/cooldown) stat at their current values. Reset your [tenacity](/docs/glossary/tenacity) to 0.
   - Keep your class sheet on its current side (if your class has been promoted, it remains so). Discard any class-related additional effects or components, such as the [Necromancer's](/docs/adventurer/classes//mage/necromancer) Necrosis Stack or the [Warden's](/docs/adventurer/classes//mage/warden) [companions](/docs/glossary/companion).
   - Discard all expended [items](/docs/adventurer/items/) and any [<img src="/icons/pet.svg" alt="Pet Icon" class="icon-svg" />](/docs/adventurer/items/types/pet) item with HP chips. Discard any active [<img src="/icons/enchantment.svg" alt="Enchantment Icon" class="icon-svg" />](/docs/adventurer/items/types/enchantment) item cards. You retain your other item cards.
4. Each player places their sheets and cards on their adventurer mat and stacks their mat into their individual storage tray.
   - Each player who has a deluxe adventurer inventory accessory can store their sheets and cards in the accessory on top of their adventurer mat.
   - The party leader stores the campaign journal together with their adventurer.
5. Disassemble the other components and place them back in their storage trays, separating province- or quest-specific components from the general components.

## Continuing a Campaign

The campaign experience is designed so that you can properly record your progress and store the components away between sessions, smoothly resuming the campaign when you are ready.

### Campaign Setup

To continue a campaign, follow these steps:

1. **Choose Difficulty:** It is possible to choose a different game [difficulty level](/docs/campaign/difficulty-levels/) from previous sessions.
2. **Set Up Adventurers:** Each player takes their adventurer's mat, sheets, and cards from the storage tray and sets up their adventurer. Each adventurer starts at their full HP, with their saved XP, with no [tenacity](/docs/glossary/tenacity), and with all of their skill dice in their attribute rows. If the adventurer has promoted their [class](/docs/adventurer/classes//), they place their class sheet master side up.
   - The previous session's party leader places the campaign journal and sets the XP Dial to the correct position.
3. **Set Up Components:** Refer to the journal from the party's last session to determine the province and quest for this session. Refer to the [province's](/docs/campaign/provinces/) gazetteer for the rest of this procedure, starting with its gazetteer page. Follow any additional setup instructions for the chosen quest or endgame. Then follow the setup procedure as normal, but leave the party XP Dial set at its stored position from the previous session (the Day Dial is reset to 1). Choose a party leader to fill out the journal for this session. That player will keep the same campaign journal page that was used in the previous session and add new information to it as needed.

## Losing the Campaign

Failing a session's guild quest (or campaign endgame) means your party has lost both the session and the campaign. To avoid this fate, your party can use its [guild assist](/docs/glossary/guild-assist) ability once per campaign. This powerful ability can rally adventurers during a battle or quickly move the party across the overland map in time for a crucial encounter.

If you truly lose the campaign, disassemble the components and store them as described in Successfully Completing a Session.
