   # Dark Brotherhood
    A guild of zealous assassins, these amoral professionals will take on any contract if the correct rites are enacted. Members of the Dark Brotherhood are accountable only to themselves, their strict bylaws, and their dark god, Sithis.

On your [turn](/docs/glossary/turn) in battle, you may use this item to apply the [Fear](/docs/battles/status-effects/fear) (<img src="/icons/fear.svg" alt="Fear Icon" className="icon-svg" />) status die to an [adjacent](/docs/glossary/adjacent) [enemy](/docs/glossary/enemy).

:::info
**How does Mark of the Black Hand work?**

When you apply the die to an adjacent enemy, the die is removed from your [ready slot](/docs/adventurer/items/inventory). To get another [Fear](/docs/battles/status-effects/fear) (<img src="/icons/fear.svg" alt="Fear Icon" className="icon-svg" />) status die, you need to take the Guild Kiosk Town Action.

:::tip[FAQ]
**Can you keep the dice from Mark of the Black Hand between sessions?**

The Dark Brotherhood's guild action allows you to gain a Fear status die as an item. Just as you must discard expended items at the end of a session, you must discard items represented by dice at the end of the session as well. You cannot carry this item with you to the next session.
