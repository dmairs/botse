Each map is divided into hexes that contain the various terrain features the party interacts with, each of which has its own [map icon](/docs/iconography/). The map also includes a compass that shows the cardinal directions, as well as the directions associated with specific die rolls. Some gazetteers and [quests](/docs/campaign/quests/) instruct the party or [NPC tokens to move](/docs/campaign/day/overland-phase/npc-overland-movement) in specific ways across the overland map.
