title: Overland Tokens
hoverText:
---

The overland map uses several types of mini-chip tokens to show the position of the party, NPCs, and important locations, as well as to track the state of [province](/docs/campaign/provinces/) effects. Each province effect and [quest](/docs/campaign/quests/) describes which specific overland tokens are placed during setup, how NPC and tracking tokens move during play, and when they are removed. Some encounters also use these tokens on the battle map.
