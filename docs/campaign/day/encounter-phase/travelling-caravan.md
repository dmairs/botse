Adventurers may sometimes encounter traveling caravans in the wilderness of Tamriel, especially at unstable landmarks (<img src="/icons/unstable-landmark.svg" alt="Unstable Landmark Icon" className="icon-svg" />). Each [province](/docs/campaign/provincs/) has a caravan entry in its gazetteer. When the party encounters a caravan, it is resolved as a [town](/docs/campaign/day/encounter-phase/town) encounter using that entry.
