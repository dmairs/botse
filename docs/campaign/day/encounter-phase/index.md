The party resolves the encounter it triggered during the previous phase. [Town](/docs/campaign/day/encounter-phase/town) encounters are resolved by taking actions in that town. Other encounters are resolved as described by their text, either in the gazetteer or on the overland card.

After resolving the encounter, determine its success before proceeding to the [Rewards Phase](/docs/campaign/day/reward-phase).

If the party triggered no encounter, it **skips** this phase.

## Resolving Encounters

[Quest](/docs/campaign/quests/index) and overland encounters must be successfully completed to earn their [XP](/docs/glossary/xp) or other rewards. If an encounter allows the party to choose how to complete it, the party must choose 1 option. If the party does not meet the requirements for a choice, it cannot choose it.

Encounters have 2 outcome types: peaceful or battle. When an encounter appears on an overland card, its outcomes are indicated by an icon.

### Peaceful

A peaceful (<img src="/icons/peaceful-outcome.svg" alt="Peaceful Outcome Icon" className="icon-svg" />) outcome resolves the encounter without the players taking part in a battle. A peaceful encounter is automatically successful unless otherwise noted. If the party does not fulfill a peaceful encounter's requirements, the encounter is failed.

### Battle

A battle outcome is resolved on the battle map. There are 3 modes of battle: [clashes](/docs/battles/types/clash) (<img src="/icons/clash.svg" alt="Clash Icon" class="icon-svg" />), [delves](/docs/battles/types/delve/index) (<img src="/icons/delve.svg" alt="Delve Icon" class="icon-svg" />), and [dungeons](/docs/battles/types/dungeon) (which do not appear on overland cards and have no icon).

Quest encounters are described either in their [province's](/docs/campaign/provinces/index) gazetteer or on a [side quest](/docs/campaign/quests/side-quests) card and are triggered and resolved as their text specifies.

A battle encounter is successful if at least 1 [adventurer](/docs/glossary/adventurer) remains undefeated on the battle map and the party has achieved the objective for that encounter. If the party does not achieve a battle's objective, the encounter is failed.
