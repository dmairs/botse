**Valenwood B35 ([Eyes of the Queen](/docs/campaign/guilds/eyes-of-the-queen) guild quest, pg. 32)**

One sentence in this section has an error. Where it says "For each also remove Anchorite Deslandra." It should instead say: "Then, count the number of agents remaining in the level 10/20 bag, and remove 1 of the level 5/10 enemies on the lettered hexes for each remaining agent. If 4 agents remain in the bag, also remove Anchorite Deslandra."

The full Quest Objective should read:

> Travel to City of Ash and initiate the City of Ash dungeon, using the end of session difficulty EP (recommended by day 12, initiates the end of the quest).
>
> After deploying enemies from the EP, deploy 3 additional level 5 (if in Session 1) or level 10 (if in Session 2) enemies to Hex C, Hex D, and Hex E, and deploy quest unit: Anchorite Deslandra to Hex B. Then, count the number of agents remaining in the level 10/20 enemy bag, and remove 1 of the level 5/10 enemies agent. If at least 4 agents remain in the bag, also remove Anchorite Deslandra. For each additional agent remaining beyond 4, each adventurer gains 1 tenacity. Return the agents to the level 10/20 enemy bag after counting them.
>
> During this dungeon, Anchorite Deslandra can move up to 4 hexes.
