:::warning[Errata]
**Endgame Day 1 - Breton Marauder should be Wood Elf**

In Encounter Setup for Cyrodiil's Endgame Day 1, when you are told to deploy a level 5: Breton Marauder, you should instead deploy a level 5: Wood Elf Marauder.

The Breton cannot be used because it is on the backside of the level 1: Breton Bandit which is also used in this encounter. The Wood Elf is also what was intended for thematic purposes.

**Fort Warden - Should auto-succeed social check on day 1**

Fort Warden's [social check](/docs/campaign/day/encounter-phase/social-checks) should be automatically successful on day 1.

The text for this [town](/docs/campaign/day/encounter-phase/town) should say "If the Daggerfall Covenant is dominant, or if it is day 1, this check is automatically successful." This matches the other starting towns in Cyrodiil with social checks.

The guilds that start you in Fort Warden are the [Mages Guild](/docs/campaign/guilds/mages-guild) (A01), [Undaunted](/docs/campaign/guilds/undaunted) (A20), and [Circle of Champions](/docs/campaign/guilds/circle-of-champions) (A33).
