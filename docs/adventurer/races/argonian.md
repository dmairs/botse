The reptilian natives of [Black Marsh](/docs/campaign/provinces/black-marsh), who call themselves Saxhleel, are spiritual and hardy, fostering a deep connection with the ancient and mystical trees of their homeland. For many years, their people were treated as second-class citizens by the slaver [Dark Elves](/docs/adventurer/races/dark-elf) to the north, but after the Argonians played a pivotal role in stopping the Akaviri invasion, they allied with the Dark Elves of [Morrowind](/docs/campaign/provinces/morrowind) and the [Nords](/docs/adventurer/races/nord) of Eastern [Skyrim](/docs/campaign/provinces/skyrim) to form the Ebonheart Pact. Their humility and reserved dispositions lead many to underestimate their intellect and toughness, to potentially fatal ends.

**Ability [Argonian Resistance]**: Once per battle, when you would be dealt damage, prevent all of that damage.
