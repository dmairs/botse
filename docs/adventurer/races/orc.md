Often feared and hated by the other races of Tamriel, Orcs have long fought for recognition of their achievements (particularly compared to the [Bretons](/docs/adventurer/races/breton) of [High Rock](/docs/campaign/provinces/high-rock), with whom most strains of Orc share a home province). Due to this history of hardship, Orc culture places a high value on endurance in the face of misfortune, as well as on personal honor honed in battle. They are a vital, if sometimes neglected, element of the Daggerfall Covenant.

**Ability [Swift Warrior]**: Once per battle, after the end of your turn, gain 1 [overfatigue](/docs/glossary/fatigue) to take an immediate extra turn.
