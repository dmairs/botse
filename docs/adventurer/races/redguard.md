Though many races in Tamriel can boast of a strong martial history, few can match the pedigree of the Redguards or their prowess in single combat. Descendants of refugees from the sunken continent of Yokunda, the Redguards call the harsh desert province of [Hammerfell](/docs/campaign/provinces/unreleased/hammerfell) their home and take their position in the Daggerfall Covenant very seriously. Though they revere the sacred, these honorable humans also fear the corrupting power of magic, viewing it as less reliable than a strong blade at your side.

**Ability [Adrenaline Rush]**: Once per battle, during your turn, remove up to 3 [fatigue](/docs/glossary/fatigue) or status dice from your [cooldown track](/docs/glossary/cooldown-track) and [heal](/docs/glossary/healing) for 1 HP for each die removed. If the total HP recovered exceeds your [Health](/docs/adventurer/stats/health) stat, it is gained as [bonus HP](/docs/glossary/bonus-hp).
