Far less formal and rigid than their [Dark Elf](/docs/adventurer/races/dark-elf) and [High Elf](/docs/adventurer/races/high-elf) cousins, the Wood Elves view life as a quest for harmony between one's self and one's surroundings. Their homeland may have something to do with that outlook; the beautiful, verdant forest of [Valenwood](/docs/campaign/provinces/valenwood) is one of the most scenic and powerful environments in all of Tamriel. Wood Elves are naturally equipped to navigate their home province, with agile frames and an aptitude for hunting that is unmatched on the continent. Many Wood Elves view Valenwood's position in the Aldmeri Dominion as insignificant in comparison to the ancient concerns of the forest.

**Ability [Hunter's Eye]**: Once per battle, before any [unit's](/docs/glossary/unit) turn, apply a [Stealth](/docs/battles/status-effects/stealth) (<img src="/icons/stealth.svg" alt="Stealth Icon" class="icon-svg" />) status die to up to 2 [party members](/docs/glossary/party) in play.
