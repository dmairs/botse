The humans of [Cyrodiil](/docs/campaign/provinces/cyrodiil) are known for their civility and, in these troubled times, their lack of a stable homeland. The Imperials' once-pastoral province, which formerly housed the capital of the Second Empire, is currently engulfed in the Three Banners War, and its countrymen have either scattered to the wind or hunkered down in an attempt to outlast the violence. Fortunately, Imperials are uniquely suited to adapt to the present circumstances, as their history of trade and diplomacy has given them an advantage when navigating the shifting tides of war.

**Ability [Imperial Mettle]**: Once per battle, when you would be dealt 3 or fewer damage, prevent that damage and [instead](/docs/glossary/instead) gain that much [tenacity](/docs/glossary/tenacity).
