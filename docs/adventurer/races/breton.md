The humans of [High Rock](/docs/campaign/provinces/high-rock) are a unique people, as their ancestry is a mixture of ancient man and ancient elf. These roots have influenced Breton culture as well as their genealogy, as most Bretons have a natural aptitude for magic while retaining a connection to the nature-oriented roots (and shrewd resourcefulness) of their druidic human forbearers. They make a national pastime of chivalry and power, which has led to frequent struggles among the Breton kingdoms that make up much of the Daggerfall Covenant.

**Ability [Opportunist]**: Once per battle, when you [overtax](/docs/adventurer/items/overtax) a [<img src="/icons/weapon.svg" alt="Weapon Icon" className="icon-svg" />](/docs/adventurer/items/types/weapon) or [<img src="/icons/armor.svg" alt="Armor Icon" className="icon-svg" />](/docs/adventurer/items/types/armor), return that item to your pack instead of discarding it. You may then move a different item in your pack to a ready slot.
