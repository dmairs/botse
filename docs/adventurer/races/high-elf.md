Among the proudest and most magically adept races in Tamriel, the High Elves see themselves as the apex of civilization. The closest descendants of the continent's Elder Folk, High Elves view the isles of [Summerset](/docs/campaign/provinces/unreleased/summerset) as their homeland, with structures like the Crystal Tower or the disappearing island of Artaeum treated as monuments to their magical mastery. High Elves often embody the driving force of the Aldmeri Dominion, and their keen abilities make them more than up to the task.

**Ability [Syrabane's Boon]**: Once per battle, during your turn, place any adventurer in an [unoccupied](/docs/glossary/occupied) entrance tile hex and [heal](/docs/glossary/healing) them for 3 HP.
