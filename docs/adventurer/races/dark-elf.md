An insular people with a tumultuous past, the ash-skinned natives of [Morrowind](/docs/campaign/provinces/morrowind) lead a singular way of life. Most Dark Elves worship the living gods of the Tribunal and operate within the confines of Morrowind's rigid system of great houses, and some are still adjusting to the majority of those houses joining the larger political body of the Ebonheart Pact. Shrewd and knowledgeable, Dark Elves pride themselves on their readiness for conflict, often mastering magic, the blade, or both.

**Ability [Dynamic]**: Once per battle, during your turn, [recover](/docs/glossary/recover) any 4 skill dice from your [cooldown track](/docs/glossary/cooldown-track), replacing each with light [fatigue](/docs/glossary/fatigue).

**Can I activate the Dynamic ability even if I don't have 4 skill dice to recover?**

Do as much as you can - if you have fewer than 4 skill dice, you can still use it and recover those dice.

**How does the Dark Elf racial ability interact with the item Shoulder-Mounted Parasol?**

_The Parasol says "when you would gain any amount of light fatigue" while the racial ability says "replace..."._

Replacing is the same as gaining. You can use Shoulder-Mounted Parasol to avoid the light fatigue from Dark Elf's race ability.
