## Novice

**Upgrade**: Complete the **Bard Harder** side quest.

**Innate Ability**: Once per any unit's turn, reroll any 1 die rolled by a unit within 2 hexes of you, including yourself.

:::tip[FAQ]
**Can you reroll results that _must be resolved_?**

Some skill results state that they must be resolved. However, you are still allowed to reroll them using the Bard's innate.

Remember that the Bard's innate only functions during unit turns, so any rolls that are made outside of battle or outside of a turn, cannot be rerolled with this innate.

:::info
**Can you see the dice result of the engage before deciding to use Stagger and Sway's interrupt?**

Yes, you can make the decision to use the Bard's Stagger and Sway ability any time during that engage, so you can wait and see what the roll is.
