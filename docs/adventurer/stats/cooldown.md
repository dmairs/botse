The value of the slot where your peg is placed above the [cooldown track](/docs/glossary/cooldown-track) is your Cooldown stat. This is the number of dice removed from your cooldown track during the Recovery step of each of your turns in battle. Start from the left and remove dice equal to your stat value. Slide the remaining dice as far left as possible toward the edge of the track.
