The amount of damage prevented each time an engage or ability deals damage to a unit.

:::tip[FAQ]
Defense applies to each instance of damage that you deal to a unit, preventing damage equal to the stat. Note that an engage is considered a single instance of damage even if multiple different skills deal damage within the engage. This damage prevention applies even outside of turns.
