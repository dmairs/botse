**How often enemy defense get applied?**

Defense applies to each instance of damage that you deal to a unit, preventing damage equal to the stat. Note that an [engage](/docs/battles/adventurer-turn/engage) is considered a single instance of damage even if multiple different skills deal damage within the engage. This damage prevention applies even outside of turns.
