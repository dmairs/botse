Each player creates a unique adventurer at the outset of the first session of a campaign. To create an adventurer, follow the steps below.

1. **Select Race:** Select a [race](/docs/races/) sheet and corresponding adventurer chip. Place the sheet along the left or right side of your adventurer mat (as you prefer), and place the chip in the art area at the top of the sheet.
   - Each race's sheets and chips are double-sided, depicting different individuals of that group. There are 2 sheets for each race, allowing up to 2 players to play the same race. Flip the components to the character side you prefer (the information is the same on each side).
2. **Add Stats:** Take the circular attribute tokens for the [Health](/docs/stats/health), [Stamina](/docs/stats/stamina), and [Magicka](/docs/stats/magicka) stats shown on your race's sheet and place them in the circular slots of your mat's attribute rows. You may place an attribute token in any open circular slot. Stats are explained further below. Note: If you place 2 attributes in opposing circular slots in the same row, advancements gained in one attribute will limit the potential advancements available to the other.
   - The Health token has a numeric value; place it so the faceup side matches the starting value shown on your race sheet.
   - The Stamina and Magicka tokens do not have numeric values. Place them in their slots; then, place a number of square stat tokens of each stat's color equal to its starting value as shown on your race reference sheet in the square slots of its row, starting with the slot closest to the corresponding circular token.
