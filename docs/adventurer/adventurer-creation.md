Each player creates a unique adventurer at the outset of the first session of a campaign. To create an adventurer, follow the steps below.

1. **Select [Race](/docs/races/):** Select a race sheet and corresponding adventurer chip. Place the sheet along the left or right side of your adventurer mat (as you prefer), and place the chip in the art area at the top of the sheet.
   - Each race's sheets and chips are double-sided, depicting different individuals of that group. There are 2 sheets for each race, allowing up to 2 players to play the same race. Flip the components to the character side you prefer (the information is the same on each side).
2. **Add [Stats](/docs/stats/):** Take the circular attribute tokens for the [Health](/docs/stats/health), [Stamina](/docs/stats/stamina), and [Magicka](/docs/stats/magicka) stats shown on your race's sheet and place them in the circular slots of your mat's attribute rows. You may place an attribute token in any open circular slot. Stats are explained further below. Note: If you place 2 attributes in opposing circular slots in the same row, advancements gained in one attribute will limit the potential advancements available to the other.
   - The Health token has a numeric value; place it so the faceup side matches the starting value shown on your race sheet.
   - The Stamina and Magicka tokens do not have numeric values. Place them in their slots; then, place a number of square stat tokens of each stat's color equal to its starting value as shown on your race reference sheet in the square slots of its row, starting with the slot closest to the corresponding circular token.
3. **Add [Combat](/docs/skill-lines/combat) Skill Line:** Take this skill line's circular token and place it in an open slot. Then, add the number of Combat skill dice shown on your race sheet to that row's square slots and place that line's reference sheet near your adventurer mat.
4. **Add Starting [Skill Line](/docs/skill-lines/):** Choose 1 other skill line. Place that line's circular token in an open attribute slot. Then, add 2 of that line's level 1 skill dice to that row's square slots. Place that line's reference sheet near your adventurer mat. For your first game, it is recommended that each player chooses 1 of the following skill lines, as dealing damage is crucial in battles:
   - [Bow](/docs/skill-lines/warrior/bow) ([<img src="/icons/ranged-weapon.svg" alt="Ranged Weapon Icon" class="icon-svg" />](/docs/battle-forms/ranged-weapon)).
   - [Destruction Staff](/docs/skill-lines/mage/destruction-staff) ([<img src="/icons/magic.svg" alt="Magic Icon" class="icon-svg" />](/docs/battle-forms/magic)).
   - [One Hand and Shield](/docs/skill-lines/warrior/one-hand-and-shield) ([<img src="/icons/light-weapon.svg" alt="Light Weapon Icon" class="icon-svg" />](/docs/battle-forms/light-weapon)).
   - [Two Handed](/docs/skill-lines/warrior/two-handed) ([<img src="/icons/heavy-weapon.svg" alt="Heavy Weapon Icon" class="icon-svg" />](/docs/battle-forms/heavy-weapon)).
5. **Place Pegs:** Place a peg in the slot of your battle form tracker that matches your chosen starting skill line. Place another in the slot above the [cooldown track](/docs/glossary/cooldown-track) matching your [race's](/docs/races/) starting [Cooldown](/docs/stats/cooldown) stat. Finally, place 2 more in the leftmost slots of your [tenacity](/docs/glossary/tenacity) and Saved [XP](/docs/glossary/xp) trackers.
6. **Choose [Class](/docs/classes/):** Choose one of the following methods to determine the starting classes available to you. Whichever method you choose, place your starting class sheet with its novice side faceup along the opposite side of your adventurer mat from your race sheet. Important: This is a permanent choice, so it is recommended you add a class that complements your adventurer's stats and fits with the playstyle that interests you.
   - **Jailbreak Introduction Encounter:** If you play this encounter, choose from the available class options based on your achievements. This is recommended for your first campaign, but the Jailbreak Introduction encounter can also be played in future campaigns when players wish to make a more thematic choice.
   - **Open Choice:** Choose 1 of the available class sheets and add it to your mat.
