This special skill line represents an [adventurer's](/docs/glossary/adventurer) innate fighting ability. Combat is different from the other skill lines in that it has only 1 type of skill die. Combat dice are flexible enough to be rolled with any battle form except magic ([<img src="/icons/magic.svg" alt="Magic Icon" className="icon-svg" />](/docs/battles/battle-forms/magic)) and can be rolled in defensive battle form ([<img src="/icons/defensive.svg" alt="Defensive Icon" className="icon-svg" />](/docs/battles/battle-forms/defensive)) to prevent damage.

If an ability adds [free](/docs/glossary/free) Combat dice, enemy Combat dice are used instead of Combat skill dice. These dice do not count against your [Stamina](/docs/adventurer/stats/stamina) or [Magicka](/docs/adventurer/stats/magicka) stat but are treated as Combat dice for other effects—such as [<img src="/icons/weapon.svg" alt="Weapon Icon" className="icon-svg" />](/docs/adventurer/items/types/weapon) items.

The Combat skill line cannot be untrained. Combat dice can be untrained in the [Reward Phase](/docs/campaign/day/reward-phase).

:::info
Although Combat is shown among a [race's](/docs/adventurer/races) starting attributes, it is a [skill line](/docs/adventurer/skill-lines/) and not a [stat](/docs/adventurer/stats).
