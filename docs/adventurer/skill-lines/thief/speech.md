Speech dice all have numbbers which indicate the strength of their effects. When multiple dice of the same skill are rolled together, their numbers are combined, increasing an effect's strength.

## Speech in Social Checks

Before [adventurers](/docs/glossary/adventurer) spend any [tenacity](/docs/glossary/tenacity) to resolve a social check, adventurers with available Speech skill dice in their attribute slots may choose to roll any number of those skill dice (regardless of their [Stamina](/docs/adventurer/stats/stamina)). Instead of resolving the effects of the rolled results, the numeric values on the rolled results count toward the party's social check, reducing the amount of tenacity that must be spent to succeed at the check. Regardless of success, all rolled dice are exhausted.
