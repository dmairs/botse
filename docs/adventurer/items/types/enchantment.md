Enchantment items can augment or reshape the rules of the game. Each <img src="/icons/enchantment.svg" alt="Enchantment Icon" className="icon-svg"/> describes the game component it affects, such as “Enchant [adventurer](/docs/glossary/adventurer)” or “Enchant clash tile.” When its ability is triggered, the card is placed near or partially tucked under the affected component. The <img src="/icons/enchantment.svg" alt="Enchantment Icon" className="icon-svg"/> ability then affects that component until the card is [discarded](/docs/glossary/discard) as described by its effect or the session ends. While an ability is active, the card is no longer in the [adventurer's](/docs/glossary/adventurer) [inventory](/docs/) and is instead treated as part of the component it affects.
