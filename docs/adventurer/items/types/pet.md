Pets protect [adventurers](/docs/glossary/adventurer) from a number of harmful effects in Tamriel. However, each time the adventurer resolves a <img src="/icons/pet.svg" alt="Pet Icon" className="icon-svg" /> ability, they must add an HP chip on top of the <img src="/icons/pet.svg" alt="Pet Icon" className="icon-svg" /> card. A <img src="/icons/pet.svg" alt="Pet Icon" className="icon-svg" /> with HP chips on it must be discarded after its HP limit is reached or the session ends. These chips cannot be removed unless an ability specifically refers to them. A <img src="/icons/pet.svg" alt="Pet Icon" className="icon-svg" /> may be placed in your pack when gained, but once it is placed in a ready slot, it cannot go back into your pack.

:::tip[FAQ]
Once a pet has been placed in a ready slot, **it cannot go back into your pack**. If a game effect forces you to put a pet into your pack, you must instead discard it. One such game effect that might force this is the Native enemy skill [Freeze](/docs/battles/enemy-skills/native-skills/freeze) in [Skyrim](/docs/campaign/provinces/skyrim).
