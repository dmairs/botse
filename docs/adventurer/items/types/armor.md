hoverText: Armor items grant benefits while their owner is being [engaged](/docs/battles/adventurer-turn/engage). Each Armor has a standard ability that is resolved when an [enemy](/docs/glossary/enemy) engages an [adventurer](/docs/glossary/adventurer). However, each Armor also has a secondary, [overtax](/docs/adventurer/items/overtax) keyword ability that can be triggered during this engage in addition to the item's standard ability.

Armor items grant benefits while their owner is being [engaged](/docs/battles/adventurer-turn/engage). Each <img src="/icons/armor.svg" alt="Armor Icon" class="icon-svg" /> has a standard ability that is resolved when an [enemy](/docs/glossary/enemy) engages an [adventurer](/docs/glossary/adventurer). However, each <img src="/icons/armor.svg" alt="Armor Icon" class="icon-svg" /> also has a secondary, [overtax](/docs/adventurer/items/overtax) keyword ability that can be triggered during this engage in addition to the item's standard ability. An adventurer must choose whether to use an <img src="/icons/armor.svg" alt="Armor Icon" class="icon-svg" /> ability, including its overtax ability, before damage is dealt. Each <img src="/icons/armor.svg" alt="Armor Icon" class="icon-svg" /> item's [trait](/docs/adventurer/items/trait) is the body area it is worn on; an adventurer can have only 1 <img src="/icons/armor.svg" alt="Armor Icon" class="icon-svg" /> with each [trait](/docs/adventurer/items/trait) in their ready slots.

:::tip[FAQ]
**Is there a limit to how many times it can be used in a round?**

Armor can be used each time an enemy [engages](/docs/battles/enemy-turn) you (meaning it targets you). If you are engaged multiple times in a [round](/docs/battles/battle-round), you can use the armor on each engage (as long as you don't [overtax](/docs/adventurer/items/overtax) it which causes it to be [discarded](/docs/glossary/discard)).

**When do you choose to Overtax?**

When you overtax armor, you can wait to see what the [enemy rolls](/docs/battles/enemy-turn) before deciding if you want to overtax it.
