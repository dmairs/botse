Consumable items represent a variety of foods and beverages. Each <img src="/icons/consumable.svg" alt="Consumable Icon"  className="icon-svg" /> can be used once and must then be [discarded](/docs/glossary/discard). However, <img src="/icons/consumable.svg" alt="Consumable Icon"  className="icon-svg" /> often have effects that can benefit multiple [party members](/docs/glossary/party). If a <img src="/icons/consumable.svg" alt="Consumable Icon"  className="icon-svg" /> is discarded during the [End of Day Phase's Adventurers Rest](/docs/campaign/day/encounter-phase/index) step (which is required if playing on [Expert Difficulty](/docs/campaign/difficulty-levels/expert)), the [adventurer](/docs/glossary/adventurer) may also resolve that item's effects (if applicable).

**Do you get the effect of a consumable item when other effects cause you to discard it?**

No. You have to use the item to get its effect. Though discarding it is part of using it, something else forcing you to discard it does not trigger its use.
