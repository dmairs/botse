This means the [item](/docs/adventurer/items/) is reusable, but must be refreshed after each use. When an item's expend ability is used, that card is rotated sideways to show that it has been expended. An expended item still takes up an inventory slot, but its effect can no longer be used until it is refreshed. An expended [<img src="/icons/potion.svg" alt="Potion Icon" class="icon-svg" />](/docs/adventurer/items/types/potion) may be refreshed and turned upright by visiting an alchemy station in [town](/docs/campaign/day/encounter-phase/town).
