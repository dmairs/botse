---

This stat is tracked by green square tokens and represents the adventurer's capacity to move and roll dice for physical skills. Stamina limits some adventurer actions during battle turns, including their movement and explore action distance, as well as their engage action [range](/docs/glossary/range) and number of dice they can roll.

The Stamina stat cannot be untrained. Stamina green square tokens can be untrained in the [Reward Phase](/docs/day/reward-phase).
