Dice are placed here as the [adventurer](/docs/glossary/adventurer) exhausts their skill dice or gains [fatigue](/docs/glossary/fatigue) and [status effect](/docs/battles/status-effects/) dice. The [Cooldown](/docs/adventurer/stats/cooldown) stat determines the number of dice that are removed from the track each [turn](/docs/glossary/turn).

- Dice added to the track are placed one at a time in the track's leftmost available spot (to the right of all remaining dice). While a skill die is in the cooldown track, it is not available.
  - If multiple dice must be placed in the cooldown track at the same time, you can place those dice in the order you choose (including exhausted skill dice).
- Any time a die is removed from the cooldown track, slide all remaining dice leftwards to remove any gaps.
- The cooldown track can fit up to 13 dice. If the track is full and a die must be placed in it, that die must either be [drained](/docs/glossary/drained) (if a skill die) or returned to the supply (if a [fatigue](/docs/glossary/fatigue) or [status](/docs/battles/status-effects/) die). Then, replace the rightmost non-overfatigue die in the track with an overfatigue die. The replaced die must also either be [drained](/docs/glossary/drained) or returned to the supply depending on its type.
- Dice placed in the cooldown track at any point remain there until they are removed during your Recovery step in battle, your [Adventurers Rest](/docs/day/end-of-day-phase) step, or an inn town action.
- If an [adventurer](/docs/glossary/adventurer) would gain a status effect die with a side that they already have in their cooldown track, the die in their cooldown track is removed from its current position and placed back in the leftmost open position.

Dice still in an [adventurer's](/docs/glossary/adventurer) cooldown track at the end of a battle remain there until the next battle or until they are removed by other means, such as during the [End of Day Phase](/docs/day/end-of-day-phase) or visiting a town's inn.

### Cooldown Track on Skill Abilities

This skill die is exhausted. The die's ability is resolved as described in its entry and is typically ongoing until it is removed from the cooldown track. If for any reason you decide not to resolve a <img src="/icons/cooldown-track.svg" alt="Cooldown Track Icon" class="icon-svg" /> result, place it in your cooldown track with the [<img src="/icons/tenacity.svg" alt="Tenacity Icon" class="icon-svg"/>](/docs/glossary/tenacity) result face up (without gaining [tenacity](/docs/glossary/tenacity)).
