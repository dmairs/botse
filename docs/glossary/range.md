Range (or distance) from one hex to another is measured by counting the number of hexes between those hexes, including the destination hex, regardless of whether those hexes are [occupied](/docs/glossary/occupied).

Range or distance is measured when determining how far a unit (or overland token) can move, whether an enemy is in range to engage adventurers, or whether an adventurer can affect another unit with a rolled skill die.

A unit is always within range of itself.

### Adventurer's Range

Defined by their current battle form. Some battle forms (such as [<img src="/icons/ranged-weapon.svg" alt="Ranged Weapon Icon" class="icon-svg" />](docs/battles/battle-forms/ranged-weapon) or [<img src="/icons/magic.svg" alt="Magic Icon" class="icon-svg" />](docs/battles/battle-forms/magic)) have a range equal to an adventurer's [Stamina](/docs/stats/stamina) or [Magicka](/docs/stats/magicka) stat, while others allow only [adjacent](/docs/glossary/adjacent) units to be within range.

### Enemy's Range

Equal to its range stat.

### Does Range apply to all skills?

No, range is taken into consideration only for skills that apply to targets, [targetable](/docs/glossary/targetable) enemies, or enemies within range. Take for example, [Destruction Staff's](/docs/adventurer/skill-lines/mage/destruction-staff) Destructive Touch. This says "[Defeat](/docs/glossary/defeated) a level 1 [enemy](/docs/glossary/enemy)." This enemy can be anywhere in play. It does not need to be in range or even in [sight](/docs/glossary/sight).
