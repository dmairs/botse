If an ability says "do **X** **then** do **Y**", **X** is considered a cost and must be paid before you can perform **Y**. This is also applicable to abilities that say "you **must** do **X** to do **Y**".

:::note[Example]
The [Bow](/docs/adventurer/skill-lines/warrior/bow) skill line's Volley ability is _"Deal a total of 4 damage, distributed as you choose among enemies adjacent to you. **Then**, place yourself in an unoccupied hex 2-4 hexes away from your current hex."_

You must be able to deal damage to enemies adjacent to you, to be able to perform "place yourself in an unoccupied hex 2-4 hexes away". The damage is the cost to perform the movement.
