If an ability says you must do one thing **then** do another, the first portion of that ability is the cost.

:::note[Example]
The [Bow](/docs/adventurer/skill-lines/warrior/bow) skill line's Volley ability is _"Deal a total of 4 damage, distributed as you choose among enemies adjacent to you. **Then**, place yourself in an unoccupied hex 2-4 hexes away from your current hex."_

You must be able to deal damage to enemies adjacent to you, to be able to perform "place yourself in an unoccupied hex 2-4 hexes away". The damage is the cost to perform the movement.
