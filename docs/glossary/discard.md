hoverText: Cards are discarded to a seperate discard stack. Dice return to the supply. Defeated enemy chips go to a defeated enemy stack. Other chips go to the appropriate draw bag or supply.

When a player is instructed to discard a card, die, or chip, they do the following:

- Cards are discarded to form a separate discard stack for that type of card. Each card discarded is placed on top of the stack. After all cards of that type are discarded, shuffle the discard stack facedown to reform the deck (unless instructed otherwise).
- Dice are discarded back to the supply and placed with other dice of their type.
- Enemy chips defeated in battle are discarded to form a defeated enemy stack. Otherwise, chips are discarded back to the appropriate draw bag or to the supply and placed with other chips of their type.
