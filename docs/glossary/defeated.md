A [unit](/docs/glossary/unit) is defeated when it loses its last HP chip or an effect states that it is defeated. The defeated unit is removed from the map. A defeated unit cannot take [turns](/docs/glossary/turn).

### Defeated Enemies

When a defeated [enemy](/docs/glossary/enemy) is removed from the battle map, place it on top of the defeated enemy stack near the map. If it is the first enemy defeated during the battle, use it to create the defeated enemy stack. If the enemy is a [quest unit](/docs/glossary/quest-unit) or an objective unit, do not place it in the defeated enemy stack and instead set it aside.

### Defeated Adventurers

When a defeated [adventurer](/docs/glossary/adventurer) is removed from the battle map, place their chip on their race sheet. Any dice in the adventurer's [active slots](/docs/glossary/active-slot) must be removed and exhausted. Dice in the defeated adventurer's [cooldown track](/docs/glossary/cooldown-track) remain there. While defeated, an adventurer cannot take [turns](/docs/glossary/turn) or gain [fatigue](/docs/glossary/fatigue) or overfatigue (including during [fatigue rounds](/docs/glossary/fatigue-damage)).

Item cards remain in the adventurer's ready slots and pack but cannot be used while the adventurer is defeated.

In battle, a defeated adventurer can be affected only by friendly abilities that specifically apply to a defeated adventurer. When that adventurer's HP is raised above 0, they are revived and no longer defeated. If this happens in battle, the revived adventurer is deployed to an [unoccupied](/docs/glossary/occupied.) hex as described by the ability that revived them.

### Full Party Defeat

If your entire [party](/docs/glossary/party) is defeated, the encounter ends after the current [round](/docs/battles/battle-round), unless the party triggers its [guild assist](/docs/glossary/guild-assist). Treat a full party defeat as a failed encounter and follow the steps below:

1.  Place the party token in the [closest](/docs/glossary/closest) [town](/docs/campaign/day/encounter-phase/town) (<img src="/icons/town.svg" alt="Town Icon" className="icon-svg" />) to the party's current location on the overland map.
2.  Resolve the [Reward Phase](/docs/campaign/day/reward-phase).
3.  Resolve the [End of Day Phase's](/docs/campaign/day/end-of-day-phase) Adventurers Rest step as normal. If playing on [Expert](/docs/campaign/difficulty-levels/expert) and the full party is defeated, [adventurers](/docs/glossary/adventurer) [heal](/docs/glossary/healing) for 1 HP even if they do not [discard](/docs/glossary/discard) an item (but still must discard an item to [recover](/docs/glossary/recover) a die from their [cooldown track](/docs/glossary/cooldown-track)).

### Defeating Units

Some abilities refer to units defeating other units, either as part of an effect or for triggering another effect.

These abilities follow the definitions below:

- An [adventurer](/docs/glossary/adventurer) (or [companion](/docs/glossary/companion)) defeats an [enemy](/docs/glossary/enemy) when either of the following occurs:
  - That enemy loses its last HP chip because of an [engage](/docs/battles/adventurer-turn/engage) or ability resolved by the adventurer.
  - The adventurer resolves an ability that indicates that enemy is defeated.
- An [enemy](/docs/glossary/enemy) defeats a [unit](/docs/glossary/unit) when that unit loses its last HP chip, either because of an [engage](/docs/battles/adventurer-turn/engage) or ability resolved by that enemy.
- If a [unit](/docs/glossary/unit) is defeated by a [status effect](/docs/battles/status-effects/index) die, such as [Bane (<img src="/icons/bane.svg" alt="Bane Icon" className="icon-svg" />)](/docs/battles/status-effects/bane), it is considered defeated but does not trigger any effect that requires the unit to have been defeated by a specific other unit.

### Defeated Units on Tiles

Some encounter rules or other abilities refer to defeated [units](/docs/glossary/unit) remaining on the tiles in battle.

These units follow the rules below:

- The unit's chip remains in its hex until it is removed as described by the effect. Until the chip is removed, its hex is considered [occupied](/docs/glossary/occupied).
- While it is on the battle map, that defeated [unit](/docs/glossary/unit) cannot take turns and its chip is not a [targetable](/docs/glossary/targetable) unit for [engage](/docs/battles/adventurer-turn/engage) actions or other abilities (unless specifically instructed). The unit's chip is treated as a defeated unit of its type for resolving abilities.
