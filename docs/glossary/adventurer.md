Each player-created adventurer is a [party member](/docs/glossary/party), whether they are your specific adventurer or another player's. If an effect's value is determined using the [party size icon (<img src="/icons/party-size.svg" alt="Party Size Icon" class="icon-svg" />)](/docs/glossary/party-size), it is based only on the number of adventurers in the party.
