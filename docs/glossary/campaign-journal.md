As the [party](/docs/glossary/party) proceeds through the campaign, it uses its campaign journal to write down information that cannot be tracked on the adventurers' mats. The journal records each session's events on a single sheet for reference later, especially at the start of future sessions.

Journal sheets are provided on the included pad or can be printed from the [Chip Theory Games website](/docs/https://chiptheorygames.com/support/the-elder-scrolls-support/).
