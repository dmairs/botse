Dice placed in active slots are referred to as active dice. An active die remains in its slot until you remove it as described in its skill line's reference sheet or at the [end of battle](/docs/battles/end-of-battle). You can have no more than 4 dice in your active slots at a time.

To free up space, you may remove an active die from one of your slots at any time during your turn without resolving that die's ability. Certain effects can also cause you to remove a die from its slot. When an active skill die is removed from its slot without resolving its ability, that die is exhausted and placed in the [cooldown track](/docs/glossary/cooldown-track) of the [adventurer](/docs/glossary/adventurer) who placed it.

Active dice **must** be removed at the [end of battle](/docs/battles/end-of-battle) or if your [adventurer](/docs/glossary/adventurer) is [defeated](/docs/glossary/defeated). Dice removed in this way must be exhausted.

### Fatigue dice in Active Slots

Some abilities can place a [fatigue](/docs/glossary/fatigue) die in an active slot. While that die is filling an active slot, it is treated like a skill die and remains there until it is removed, after which it is placed in the cooldown track. As with active skill dice, this happens when:

- the skill's ability describes
- when you choose to remove that die without resolving an ability
- when you are [defeated](/docs/glossary/defeated)
- when the battle ends.

### Active Slot on Skill Abilities

This skill die must be placed in 1 of your active slots (or, if specified by the skill, the active slot of another [adventurer](/docs/glossary/adventurer)). The die's ability is resolved as described in its entry, typically by reducing the die's value or removing it from its slot. When a die is removed from an active slot, it is exhausted unless its ability specifies otherwise.

**When can I choose to exhaust a skill die from an active slot?**

At any point during your turn. This means, you may exhaust a die and move it to the [coodlown track](/docs/glossary/cooldown-track) prior to the [Recovery step](/docs/battles/adventurer-turn/index/#2-recovery).
