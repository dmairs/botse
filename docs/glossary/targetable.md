A unit is targetable by another unit if it is in [range](/docs/glossary/range) and [sight](/docs/glossary/sight) of the unit that would target it and does not have an effect that prevents it from being targeted. An adventurer's range
is limited by their current [battle form](/docs/battle-forms). An enemy's range is limited by its range stat. Some abilities can apply effects to targetable units outside of an engage action or allow a unit to target allies. Some abilities can also deal damage to units without targeting those units.
