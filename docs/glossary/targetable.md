A unit is targetable by another unit if it is in [range](/docs/glossary/range) and [sight](/docs/glossary/sight) of the unit that would target it and does not have an effect that prevents it from being targeted. An adventurer's range is limited by their current [battle form](/docs/battle-forms). An enemy's range is limited by its range stat. Some abilities can apply effects to targetable units outside of an engage action or allow a unit to target allies. Some abilities can also deal damage to units without targeting those units

:::info
The target has to be in range when selected as a target and when the die is resolved.

**Declaring a Target**

You only declare a target if the game structure tells you to. i.e. as part of an [engage](/docs/battles/adventurer-turn/engage), or if something else in the game tells you to select a target. You can't just randomly select yourself a target in order to use something that triggers based off of selecting a target.
