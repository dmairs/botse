See also: [Status Effects](/docs/status-effects/).

This skill die is placed in a unique manner (for example, on an enemy or in a hex), and its ability is resolved as described in its entry. When a status effect skill die is removed from its current position, that die is exhausted unless its ability specifies otherwise.

Note that [quest units](/docs/glossary/quest-unit) cannot gain status effects from [adventurer](/docs/glossary/adventurer) abilities.

:::info
Status effects are not removed from [adventurers](/docs/glossary/adventurer) automatically after battle. They remain in the [cooldown track](/docs/glossary/cooldown-track) until/unless they are removed.

Status effects are removed from all other [units](/docs/glossary/unit), including [enemies](/docs/glossary/enemy) and [companions](/docs/glossary/companion), at the end of battle.
