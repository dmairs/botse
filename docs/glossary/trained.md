All skill dice that have been added to your character mat are considered to be trained. It does not matter whether you started with the die or gained it by spending [XP](/docs/glossary/xp), and it does not matter where in play the die is, whether it's in [Cooldown](/docs/glossary/cooldown-track) or even if it's [drained](/docs/glossary/drained) - all skill dice you've acquired, unless you've untrained them, are considered trained.
