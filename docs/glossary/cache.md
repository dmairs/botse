Caches are locked containers found on the battle map that [adventurers](/docs/glossary/adventurer) may open to gain item cards. Each <img src="/icons/common-item.svg" alt="Common Item Icon" class="icon-svg" /> chip contains 1 common item card. Each <img src="/icons/legendary-item.svg" alt="Legendary Item Icon" class="icon-svg" /> chip contains 1 legendary item card.

During their [turn](/docs/glossary/turn), when an [adventurer](/docs/glossary/adventurer) [moves into or is placed](/docs/glossary/move-or-place) in a hex with a cache chip, they may trigger a [lockpick](/docs/glossary/lockpicking) check on that cache. The lockpick check uses a difficulty code, which is a series of numbers that must be matched to unlock it. The difficulty code for a check on a cache chip is shown on the back of the top card of the associated item deck.

- If the check is successful, the cache is unlocked and the chip is [discarded](/docs/glossary/discard). The [adventurer](/docs/glossary/adventurer) draws that card faceup and may add it to their [inventory's](/docs/glossary/inventory) ready slots or pack. If the adventurer chooses not to take the unlocked card, they discard both that card and its cache chip.
- If the check fails, the cache chip is [discarded](/docs/glossary/discard) and the top card of the relevant item deck must be cycled by placing it on the bottom of its deck.
- Some encounters use a cache's lockpick check to determine if another effect is triggered. In this case, do not gain the item. Instead, cycle the item card used, whether the adventurer succeeds or fails at that check. After the lockpick check, the cache chip is [discarded](/docs/glossary/discard) unless specified otherwise.
