Traps represent harmful mechanical or magical effects. They appear in red boxes on many delve cards.

Traps have the following elements:

- A name.
- A difficulty code (see [Lockpicking](/docs/glossary/lockpicking)).
- Text describing the effect resolved.

During their turn, an [adventurer](/docs/glossary/adventurer) must trigger a trap when they enter a hex on a tile with a trap effect, either by moving into that hex or being placed there. Enemies and companions do not trigger traps but can be affected by them if specified by the trap's text.

## Trap Sequence

When a trap is triggered, follow the steps below to resolve that trap. The trap's lockpick check and effect must be resolved before any other effects that would trigger by an adventurer moving into that hex, such as attempting to unlock a cache.

1. The adventurer who triggered the trap must make a [lockpick](/docs/glossary/lockpicking) check against the trap's difficulty code.
2. Resolve the trap's effect. A trap's effect will specify whether it triggers when the lockpick check is successful or unsuccessful. Once a trap's effect is resolved, the trap becomes inactive and cannot be triggered again unless otherwise specified.
   - If the trap is on a card with no remaining effects to resolve, [discard](/docs/glossary/discard) the card.
   - If the trap does not specify affected units, its ability is resolved only against the adventurer who triggered it. If the trap is resolved against multiple units, resolve it for each in the order chosen by the adventurer who triggered the trap.
