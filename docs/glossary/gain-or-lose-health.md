Some effects can affect a [unit's](/docs/glossary/unit) [Health](/docs/stats/health) stat or its HP chips.

### Gaining or Losing Health

When an effect increases a [unit's](/docs/glossary/unit) [Health](/docs/stats/health) stat, that unit gains a number of HP chips equal to the difference in value. If a unit's Health stat decreases below the value of HP chips the unit currently has, remove HP until the unit has HP equal to its new maximum.

### Gaining or Losing HP

When an effect adds HP chips in excess of a unit's Health stat—but does not change the stat itself—those chips remain until the next [end of battle](/docs/battles/end-of-battle) cleanup step. Note that a unit can only gain HP in excess of its Health stat if the effect specifically allows for it.
