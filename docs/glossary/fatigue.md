These dice are placed in your [adventurer's](/docs/glossary/adventurer) [cooldown track](/docs/glossary/cooldown-track) when they gain fatigue. There are 2 types of fatigue. If a game effect refers to fatigue without specifying its type, that effect can apply to either type.

### Light Fatigue

These are silver. When a light fatigue die is removed from the [cooldown track](/docs/glossary/cooldown-track), that die is returned to the supply. If there are no silver dice in the supply when light fatigue is gained, gain overfatigue.

### Overfatigue

These are black. When an overfatigue die would be removed from the [cooldown track](/docs/glossary/cooldown-track) during the Recovery step, it is instead placed in the track's leftmost open position. Overfatigue in the cooldown track deals damage to the adventurer during fatigue rounds in battle. It can only be removed during the Adventurers Rest step, by taking an inn [town](/docs/campaign/day/encounter-phase/town) action, or by a game effect or special ability.

### When you can take "any amount" of fatigue, is there a limit to this?

In a situation where you can take "any amount" of fatigue, there is **no limit** to how much fatigue you can take. The rules tell you what to do if you can't take a light fatigue or overfatigue, and also what to do if you'd take fatigue when your cooldown is full. Outside of those consequences, there is no limit.

This is particularly of note for the Palefrost Elk pet item which, when you would take any amount of fatigue, allows you to ignore the fatigue and put an HP chip on the pet instead. In combination with a situation where you can take any amount of fatigue, you can declare you are taking as much fatigue as you would like, and then ignore all of that fatigue.
