These dice are placed in your adventurers [cooldown track](/docs/glossary/cooldown-track) when they gain fatigue. There are 2 types of fatigue. If a game effect refers to fatigue without specifying its type, that effect can apply to either type.

### Light Fatigue

These are silver. When a light fatigue die is removed from the [cooldown track](/docs/glossary/cooldown-track), that die is returned to the supply. If there are no silver dice in the supply when light fatigue is gained, gain overfatigue.

### Overfatigue

These are black. When an overfatigue die would be removed from the [cooldown track](/docs/glossary/cooldown-track) during the Recovery step, it is instead placed in the track's leftmost open position. Overfatigue in the cooldown track deals damage to the adventurer during fatigue rounds in battle. It can only be removed during the Adventurers Rest step, by taking an inn town action, or by a game effect or special ability.
