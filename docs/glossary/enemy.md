All opposing [units](/docs/glossary/unit) to the [party](/docs/glossary/party) are considered enemies, regardless of their level.

Some units that otherwise belong to the party can be temporarily designated as enemies by game effects. These units behave as instructed by the specific effect.

In battle, the party's enemies are represented by double-sided chips, with each side showing an enemy of a different level. Level 1 and level 5 enemies back to each other and share a draw bag, as do level 10 and level 20 enemies. The higher the level is, the more difficult the enemy.
