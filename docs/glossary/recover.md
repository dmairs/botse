title: Recover
hoverText: An adventurer may only recover a die from their cooldown track. A drained die can only be recovered by an ability that specifically affects drained dice.
---

When an exhausted skill die is removed from the [cooldown track](/docs/glossary/cooldown-track) by your Recovery step or another effect, you recover that die. Place it in the correct slot in your attribute rows. That die is immediately available to use. When a status effect die is removed from the cooldown track, return it to the supply.

A [drained](/docs/glossary/drained) die can only be recovered by an effect that specifically recovers drained dice, by visiting an inn during a [town](/docs/campaign/day/encounter-phase/town) encounter, or during the Adventurers Rest step of the [End of Day Phase](/docs/campaign/day/end-of-day-phase).
