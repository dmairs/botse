Some abilities refer to units removing other units from the map. Removing a unit is not the same as defeating a unit, so follow the rules below.

- An enemy that is removed from the map by an ability instead of being defeated is placed back in its enemy bag instead of on the defeated enemy stack.
- Enemies removed in this way do not trigger any effect that requires the enemy to have been defeated.
