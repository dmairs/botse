A unit is defined as any chip in the game with the following characteristics:

- A unit has stats, abilities, or both.
- A unit either takes its own turn on the battle map or is controlled during another unit's turn.

:::info
Chips used for tracking purposes that do not have these characteristics are not units.
:::

All units fall under 2 categories: [party](/docs/glossary/party) and [enemy](/docs/glossary/enemy).

These 2 categories, in relation to one another, are referred to as **opposing units**. Units that are not opposing cannot target one another unless an effect specifically allows them to.
