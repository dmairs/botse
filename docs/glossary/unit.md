A unit is defined as any chip in the game with the following characteristics:

- A unit has stats, abilities, or both.
- A unit either takes its own turn on the battle map or is controlled during another unit's turn.

Chips used for tracking purposes that do not have these characteristics are not units.

All units fall under 2 categories: [party](/docs/glossary/party) and [enemy](/docs/glossary/enemy).

These 2 categories, in relation to one another, are referred to as **opposing units**. Units that are not opposing cannot target one another unless an effect specifically allows them to.
