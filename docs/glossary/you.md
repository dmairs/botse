Card text and other effects frequently address the player or players as **"you"**. This can mean different things depending on the context.

- **Overland cards, side quest cards, and quest steps** use "you" to refer to the [party](/docs/glossary/party) collectively. For example, if a quest step refers to you traveling to a location, it is referring to the movement of the party's token on the overland map.

- **Class cards, item cards, skill abilities, and similar effects** use "you" to refer to the individual [adventurer](/docs/glossary/adventurer). That adventurer's player makes any decisions involving these effects.
