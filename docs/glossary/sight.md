Some actions and abilities require that the unit resolving them has sight to another unit or a hex on the battle map. A unit has sight to another unit (or hex) if both units are in hexes on the same tile or an [adjacent](/docs/glossary/adjacent) tile.

For example, in a clash battle, an adventurer on the entrance tile has sight to an enemy on the clash tile or the entrance tile.

A unit is always in sight of itself.
