If a player is ever instructed to roll a D6, that player should use the same six-sided dice used for lockpick checks. When rolling one of these dice as a D6 outside of a lockpick check, players cannot use skills or other effects that can manipulate those dice during lockpick checks.

**What does "Roll a D6 + X" mean?**

The +X, is the number of additional dice you roll. E.g. "Roll a d6 +2", would mean to roll 3 dice total (1+2).
