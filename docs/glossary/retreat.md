The [party](/docs/glossary/party) may agree to retreat at the end of any round. If the party retreats, the encounter immediately ends. This can be helpful to save time and resources by preventing adventurers from likely defeat, but this means the encounter is failed, and the party does not gain the rewards for completing it.

:::note
The exception is in delve battles with the Uncover objective, when the party must retreat after gaining the required [skyshards](/docs/glossary/skyshard) to succeed.
