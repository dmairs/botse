An effect that refers to healing a [unit](/docs/glossary/unit) allows it to recover the specified amount of HP chips. A unit cannot heal in excess of its [Health](/docs/adventurer/stats/health) stat.

When a [party](/docs/glossary/party) member resolves an effect that heals another party member unit for a number of HP, the unit resolving the effect chooses the amount of HP that is actually healed. This amount may be equal to or less than the number specified by the effect (to a minimum of 0). This is also true for an effect that causes an [adventurer](/docs/glossary/adventurer) to gain an amount of [bonus HP](/docs/glossary/bonus-hp).

:::info
**Does healing pool?**

Healing doesn't pool. If you resolve multiple healing abilities back-to-back, sure, take it all together. However, it could be important they don't pool for order of resolution. Say you heal a little, then do something that results in you taking some damage, then you resolve something else that heals you again.

:::tip[FAQ]
**Is how much you healed based on HP gained or the healing given?**

If a game effect depends on how much a unit healed, the amount considered is the amount of HP **actually gained**, not the amount of healing that the healing ability offered.
