When you gain tenacity (<img src="/icons/tenacity.svg" alt="Tenacity Icon" class="icon-svg" />), you track it using the peg slots at the bottom right side of your adventurer mat. Accumulated tenacity remains until it is spent to trigger a class ability or reduced by another effect. If you increase your tenacity to its maximum value, you cannot increase it again until you spend (or lose) some tenacity.

Tenacity is typically gained by resolving dice results with the <img src="/icons/tenacity.svg" alt="Tenacity Icon" class="icon-svg" /> icon but can also be gained from other specied dice abilities or effects.

### Non-Standard Tenacity Results

Some abilities cause additional dice to be rolled with <img src="/icons/tenacity.svg" alt="Tenacity Icon" class="icon-svg" /> or other results that would cause an adventurer to gain tenacity in specific ways.

Adventurers:

- Only gain tenacity for dice results they rolled during an engage, regardless of whose turn it is.
- Do not gain tenacity when they are instructed to exhaust dice or place dice in their [cooldown track](/docs/glossary/cooldown-track) with a tenacity result faceup.
