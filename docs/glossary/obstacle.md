Some battle encounters use tiles as obstacles that prevent movement through hexes. These tiles are placed facedown on top of other tiles, typically during setup. These are the most common obstacles encountered and follow the rules below.

- Obstacles are [impassable](/docs/glossary/impassable)
- When an encounter uses tiles as obstacles, its setup diagram will show where those tiles are placed using red hexes to show their shape and positioning. Note: Some encounters feature tiles marked in blue to better distinguish which tiles are needed to form the battle map. Blue tiles do not have any special effects or rules.

Some encounters use other types of components as special obstacles. These obstacles are unique and follow the rules described in their encounter.
