Some abilities allow [units](/docs/glossary/unit) to perform an additional engage, roll additional dice during an engage, or move additional hexes.When clarification is needed, these abilities sometimes use the term **"free"**. These abilities follow the rules below.

### Actions

An additional engage or other action granted by an ability does not count against an [adventurer's](/docs/glossary/adventurer) action limits if resolved during their [turn](/docs/glossary/turn), or against the limits of the active adventurer if resolved during another's turn. An additional engage action does not require an adventurer to gain a [fatigue](/docs/glossary/fatigue) unless that ability specifies otherwise, even if that additional engage is not the first performed by that adventurer during their turn.

### Dice

Additional dice do not count against an [adventurer's](/docs/glossary/adventurer) [Stamina](/docs/stats/stamina) or [Magicka](/docs/stats/magicka) stat, or against a non-adventurer unit's [Combat](/docs/skill-lines/combat) stat. Additional dice can be added to an adventurer's roll even if they are not trained in that skill line or skill die. After additional dice are resolved, they are [discarded](/docs/glossary/discard) back to the supply instead of being exhausted to that adventurer's [cooldown track](/docs/glossary/cooldown-track). Enemy Combat dice added as additional dice cannot be added to an adventurer's [active slots](/docs/glossary/active-slot) or resolved to gain [tenacity](/docs/glossary/tenacity).

### Movement

Additional hexes of movement do not count against an [adventurer's](/docs/glossary/adventurer) [Stamina](/docs/stats/stamina) or against a non-adventurer unit's movement stat.
