Similar to the [Survey](/docs/battles/objectives/survey) objective, the [party](/docs/glossary/party) must fully explore the battle map by gaining all required [skyshards](/docs/glossary/skyshard)—by default 3—and then successfully retreat. If the party retreats before fully exploring the battle map, the encounter is failed. Unlike other objectives, the party gains [XP](/docs/glossary/xp) from each skyshard it acquires in the [delve](/docs/battles/types/delve)—up to that delve's required limit— so long as the entire party is not [defeated](/docs/glossary/defeated), in which case no XP is gained. This is true even if the party retreats before it has gained all required skyshards (see Retreating from Battle).
