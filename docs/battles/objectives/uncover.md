The [party](/docs/glossary/party) must fully explore the battle map by gaining all required [skyshards](/docs/battles/types/delve/skyshard)—by default 3—and then successfully retreat. If the party retreats before fully exploring the battle map, the encounter is failed. Unlike other objectives, the party gains [XP](/docs/glossary/xp) from each skyshard it acquires in the [delve](/docs/battles/types/delve/)—up to that delve's required limit— so long as the entire party is not [defeated](/docs/glossary/defeated), in which case no XP is gained. This is true even if the party retreats before it has gained all required skyshards (see Retreating from Battle).

**How does Uncover differ from Survey?**

| Aspect             | Uncover                                                                                                                                                         | Survey                             |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| XP Rewards         | 1 XP for each collected skyshard and encounter reward (if successful). You still gain XP for skyshards if you retreat with at least 1 party member still alive. | Encounter Reward XP only           |
| Partial Completion | You gain XP for each skyshard even if retreating before completing the encounter.                                                                               | Not possible, encounter is failed. |
| Encounter Duration | End of battle round, however it is optional even after objective is met.                                                                                        | End of battle round, not optional. |
