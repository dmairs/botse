The [party](/docs/glossary/party) must fully explore the battle map by gaining all required [skyshards](/docs/battles/types/delve/skyshard)—by default 3—and then successfully retreat. If the party retreats before fully exploring the battle map, the encounter is failed. Unlike other objectives, the party gains [XP](/docs/glossary/xp) from each skyshard it acquires in the [delve](/docs/battles/types/delve/)—up to that delve's required limit— so long as the entire party is not [defeated](/docs/glossary/defeated), in which case no XP is gained. This is true even if the party retreats before it has gained all required skyshards (see Retreating from Battle).

**How is Uncover different from Survey?**

- The party gains 1 XP for each collected [skyshard](/docs/battles/types/delve/skyshard), in addition to the encounter reward (if successful).
- If the party retreats before completing the encounter, they still gain XP for each skyshard.
- The encounter only ends when you retreat, so you may freely use subsequent turns to collect caches etc. and then retreat when you want to do so.

At least one party member must remain undefeated to gain this XP.
