The [party](/docs/glossary/party) must fully explore the battle map by gaining all required [skyshards](/docs/battles/types/delve/skyshard). The default number of required skyshards is 3, although the encounter may specify a different amount. The encounter is failed if the party does not gain all of the required skyshards. This is the most common objective for delve battles found in guild quests.

## Uncover vs Survey

| Aspect             | Uncover                                                                                                                                                         | Survey                             |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| XP Rewards         | 1 XP for each collected skyshard and encounter reward (if successful). You still gain XP for skyshards if you retreat with at least 1 party member still alive. | Encounter Reward XP only           |
| Partial Completion | You gain XP for each skyshard even if retreating before completing the encounter.                                                                               | Not possible, encounter is failed. |
| Encounter Duration | End of battle round, however it is optional even after objective is met.                                                                                        | End of battle round, not optional. |
