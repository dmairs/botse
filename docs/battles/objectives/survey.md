The [party](/docs/glossary/party) must fully explore the battle map by gaining all required [skyshards](/docs/glossary/skyshard). The default number of required skyshards is 3, although the encounter may specify a different amount. The encounter is failed if the party does not gain all of the required skyshards. This is the most common objective for delve battles found in guild quests.
