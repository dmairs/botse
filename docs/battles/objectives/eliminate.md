**If the unit is defeated and subsequently redeployed (e.g. [Necromancy](/docs/battles/enemy-skills/necromancy)), is the objective considered completed?**

No. The battle objective needs to be completed and remain completed at the end of the round. If the unit is brought back (for example by the enemy skill [Necromancy](/docs/battles/enemy-skills/necromancy)) and is back in play at the end of the round, the objective is not considered completed.

The same logic applies to the [Conquer](/docs/battles/objectives/conquer) objective. If all units are defeated but then more are deployed (for example by the enemy skill [Instigate](/docs/battles/enemy-skills/instigate)), you need to defeat these newly deployed enemies in order to complete the Conquer objective.
