**If the unit is defeated and subsequently redeployed (e.g. [Necromancy](/docs/battles/enemy-skills/necromancy)), is the objective considered completed?**

If the unit marked to be Eliminated is brought back by something like Necromancy, the Eliminate X objective is not considered complete. At the end of the round, that unit needs to be defeated in order for the objective to be counted as completed.
