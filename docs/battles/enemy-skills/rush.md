If this [unit](/docs/glossary/unit) cannot target an opposing unit after its movement, it moves a second time instead.

**Does a unit perform an engage if it uses the Rush keyword to perform a second move?**

If something rushes, it doesn't then get to engage. The "instead" means the second movement is in place of engaging.
