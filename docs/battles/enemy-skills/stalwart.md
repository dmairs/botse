This [unit](/docs/glossary/unit) [cannot](/docs/glossary/cannot) lose more than 1 HP in a single [turn](/docs/glossary/turn).

:::info
"Cannot lose HP" isn't damage prevention. This means Stalwart enemies can't lose more 1 HP regardless of source, e.g. [true damage](/docs/glossary/true-damage.md) doesn't override this.
