**What counts as trained?**

Trained is the total number you have, no matter where they are - available, in cooldown, drained. This includes dice you start with as part of Race selection.

**What happens when a unit with Colossal heals?**

The HP granted by the skill Colossal is **additional** HP. The unit's Health stat (printed on chip) is what limits healing, so it will only heal up it's Health stat.
