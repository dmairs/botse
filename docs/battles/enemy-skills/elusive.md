**How does Elusive work with damage that happens outside of a turn (e.g. [Bard](/docs/adventurer/classes/thief/bard)'s Red Mountain Drinking Song)?**

Elusive is only able to prevent damage that happens within a turn. It's not applicable to damage that happens outside of a unit's turn. So Bard's Red Mountain Drinking Song is not affected by Elusive when used after the initial enemy deployment that happens outside of a turn.
