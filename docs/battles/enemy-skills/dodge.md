:::tip[FAQ]
**What dice are considered to "deal damage"?**

Dice that deal damage must deal damage to a unit in the [engage](/docs/battles/adventurer-turn/engage) in which it was rolled. Damage is prevented for each die that does not deal damage that engage. The damage does not need to be resolved against the enemy with dodge - as long as the die deals damage to any unit within that engage, it counts as dealing damage.

Since Dodge looks at the results of your full dice roll, resolving this skill requires you to decide what you are doing with all of the damage-dealing dice you roll that engage.

A die that deals damage after the engage (even if later that same turn), or adds a [status effect](/docs/glossary/status-effect) that deals damage, or gives [tenacity](/docs/glossary/tenacity) that is used to deal damage, is not considered to deal damage.

**Can I choose to not resolve dice that were rolled as part of an engage to avoid Dodge?**

No, all dice you roll in an engage are counted towards Dodge. Even if you choose not to resolve the ability on the die.

**If I roll enemy combat dice as a part of an engage, are they also considered "skill dice" for the purpose of Dodge?**

Yes, enemy combat dice are considered skill dice.
