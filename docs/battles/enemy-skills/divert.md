This [unit](/docs/glossary/unit) cannot lose its last HP unless it is already at 1 HP prior to taking damage.

:::info
All damage dealt against an enemy during an engage is applied as a single instance. Therefore, you would need to take two engage actions to kill an enemy with Divert that has more than 1 HP prior to the first engage.
