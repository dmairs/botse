**Do Detection enemies disable class abilities that rely on stealth such as Consuming Darkness in [Nightblade](/docs/adventurer/classes/mage/nightblade)?**

While the Detection **enemy** ignores your Stealth and its effect, you still have Stealth and you don't ignore it yourself. So class abilities that are based on it are still valid.
