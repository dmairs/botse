**Does this skill effect companions?**

Since this skill drains a Combat skill die, it does not have any effect against non-[adventurer](/docs/glossary/adventurer) units, e.g. [companions](/docs/glossary/companion)

**Does this skill still trigger if the unit is defeated during the engage, e.g. 'Reflect' damage dealt via items or abilities**

After the engage does not trigger if the enemy is defeated, it needs to be on the board when the skill would trigger or else it doesn't happen.
