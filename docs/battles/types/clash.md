In a clash battle, the map is composed of 2 or more tiles placed during setup (some clashes also use additional tiles as [obstacles](/docs/glossary/obstacle)). Unlike other map tiles, the clash tile is not marked with icons. Instead, these icons are provided in the clash encounter's setup diagram, which appears in quest steps or on overland cards. The clash mat is double-sided, and either side can be used according to whichever feels more thematic to your current location.

## Enemy Pool

Clashes use an overall enemy pool (EP) to populate enemies at setup. The maximum number of enemies that can be drawn and deployed depends on both the EP and the numbered enemy hexes in the battle's setup diagram.

## Setup

1. **Set Up the Battle Map:** Place the clash tile or any other tiles in the play area as shown by the encounter.
2. **Place Cache Chips:** Place [cache](/docs/glossary/cache) chips in the hexes shown on the clash setup diagram. Ensure each chip has the proper side up depending on if it is a <img src="/icons/common-item.svg" alt="Common Item Icon" class="icon-svg" /> or <img src="/icons/legendary-item.svg" alt="Legandary Item Icon" class="icon-svg" /> cache.
3. **Deploy Enemies:** Calculate an enemy pool (EP). Then, draw and deploy each enemy chip to the next numbered hex as shown in the diagram, starting with Hex 1, until all enemies are deployed for that encounter. Draw the highest level enemy possible without exceeding the EP, subtracting its level value from the EP, and then deploy its chip with the corresponding level faceup. If the diagram shows no numbered hexes that are [unoccupied](/docs/glossary/occupied), do not deploy more enemies. Any points remaining in the EP after all enemy hexes are occupied are not used.
4. **Deploy Adventurers:** Deploy each [adventurer](/docs/glossary/adventurer) to the entrance tile. Start by choosing an adventurer to take the first player token and deploy their chip so that they occupy any single hex. Then, proceed to deploy each other adventurer in clockwise order around the table. This becomes the permanent turn order for the rest of the battle. Each adventurer may set their [battle form](/docs/battles/battle-forms/index) when deployed and choose which [item](/docs/adventurer/items/index) cards to place in their ready slots.
5. **Deploy Companions:** If adventurers have [companion](/docs/glossary/companion) units that are deployed during battle setup, deploy those companions to the entrance tile, if able. If multiple players have companions to deploy, deploy those companions in player turn order.
   - If there are no [unoccupied](/docs/glossary/occupied) hexes remaining on the entrance tile, set undeployed companions next to the entrance tile. They can enter the battle map during later [rounds](/docs/battles/battle-round).
6. **Set Round Counter:** Set the party's Round Counter die to 1 and place it in the square slot on the dial chip holder. Then, begin battle rounds. Trigger skills and other abilities with "start of battle" timing now.
