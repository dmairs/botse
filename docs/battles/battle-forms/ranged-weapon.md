**[Range](/docs/glossary/range):** Non-adjacent, up to [Stamina](/docs/adventurer/stats/stamina) stat.

Represents ranged engages using skills such as Bow. [Adjacent](/docs/glossary/adjacent) [units](/docs/glossary/unit) cannot be targeted in this form, but [range](/docs/glossary/range) is counted as normal.

For example, an adventurer in Ranged Weapon form with 3 [Stamina](/docs/adventurer/stats/stamina) can target units 2 or 3 hexes away, but not adjacent units.

:::info
**In Ranged battle form, do adjacent units count as "in range" (for example, when using the [Hawk Eye](/docs/adventurer/classes/warrior/archer) class ability)?**

No, adjacent units are not within your range if you are in Ranged battle form.
