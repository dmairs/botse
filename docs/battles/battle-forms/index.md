Battle form icons appear on skill lines, abilities, and [weapon](/docs/adventurer/items/types/weapon) items. During an [engage](/docs/battles/adventurer-turn/engage) action, the [adventurer's](/docs/glossary/adventurer) battle form limits the dice that can be rolled together and sets the adventurer's [range](/docs/glossary/range).
