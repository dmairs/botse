:::tip[FAQ]
**How does Daze and Steal interact?**

The Daze status effect says that if an enemy moves on its turn, it can't roll dice that turn. Using [Steal](/docs/battles/enemy-skills/steal) requires a die to be rolled, so a Dazed enemy that moves cannot use its Steal skill.

**Can you [lockpick](/docs/glossary/lockpicking) if you have Daze and have moved on your turn?**

No, to lockpick you need to be able to roll dice. If you have moved on your turn you are not able to lockpick.
