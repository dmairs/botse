:::tip[FAQ]
**Is stealth maintained if I use a skill that "defeats" an enemy?**

Stealth is not removed from an [adventurer](/docs/glossary/adventurer) if they use a skill or ability that says it [defeats](/docs/glossary/defeated) an [enemy](/docs/glossary/enemy). Defeating an enemy is not considered to be dealing damage.
