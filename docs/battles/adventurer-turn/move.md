When your [adventurer](/docs/glossary/adventurer) performs a move action, they move a number of hexes up to the value of their [Stamina](/docs/adventurer/stats/stamina). An ability that gives additional hexes of free movement to an adventurer outside of their move action is not treated as a move action.

For each hex of movement your adventurer is allowed, you may move to 1 [unoccupied](/docs/glossary/occupied), [adjacent](/docs/glossary/adjacent) hex.

A move action (or ability) ends when you cannot or choose not to move additional hexes. You may perform move actions up to twice per turn, but there are limitations on the move action.

- If you perform no [engage](/docs/battles/adventurer-turn/engage) actions on your current turn, you may take a second move action. If you have taken a second move action in a turn, you cannot perform any engage actions that turn.
- You cannot perform a move action if you have performed an [explore](/docs/battles/adventurer-turn/explore) action that turn; you also cannot perform an explore action if you have performed a move action.
- Your adventurer's movement cannot be interrupted by other actions, but it can be interrupted by abilities or events; if this happens, the interruption is resolved after the adventurer moves into the hex where the interruption is triggered. For example, if you move into a hex and trigger an exploration or [lockpick](/docs/glossary/lockpicking) check, you must resolve that event before continuing your move.

:::tip[FAQ]
**Movement - you can engage, then move, then engage again**

On pg. 59 of the rulebook, in the Engage section, it says: "You may perform a move action before or after you perform an engage action, but not both."

This text is meant to reinforce the rule that you cannot take two move actions in a single turn if you engage, nor can you interrupt a move action with an engage action. However, you are allowed to engage, then move, then engage again.
