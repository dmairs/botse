This action is only available during delves. When you perform this action, you count the distance to an explorable hex in [sight](/docs/glossary/sight). If it is equal to or less than your [Stamina](/docs/adventurer/stats/stamina), you trigger an exploration on that hex.

You cannot perform an explore action if you have already performed a move action that [turn](/docs/glossary/turn); you also cannot perform a move action if you have performed an explore action.

:::warning[Important]
The explore action and exploration are related concepts but are not identical terms. The explore action triggers an exploration, but exploration can also be triggered in other ways, such as moving into a <img src="/icons/door.svg" alt="Door Icon" className="icon-svg" /> hex.
