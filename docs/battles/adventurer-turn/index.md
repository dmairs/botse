During your turn, you can take a number of actions, including moving, engaging, resolving class abilities, or exploring at a distance. When it is your adventurer's turn to act, follow the steps below:

## Turn Sequence

### 1. Start of Turn

Trigger any abilities with this timing.

### 2. Recovery

Remove a number of dice from your [cooldown track](/docs/glossary/cooldown-track) equal to your [Cooldown](/docs/adventurer/stats/cooldown) stat, starting with the die furthest to the left in the track. As you remove dice, slide remaining dice in the track toward the left side to close any empty slots. Each type of die is handled as described below:

- **Skills:** [Recover](/docs/glossary/recover) and place skill dice in the correct slots in your attribute rows.
- **Fatigue:** [Discard](/docs/glossary/discard) light [fatigue](/docs/glossary/fatigue). Remove overfatigue and replace them at the leftmost **open** position in the track.
- **Status Effects:** [Discard](/docs/glossary/discard) [status](/docs/glossary/status-effect) dice.

### 3. Adventurer Actions

Perform 1 or more of the below actions in any order you choose. You must resolve each action before you perform another action. Some actions prevent an adventurer from performing others, but there is no hard limit to the number of actions an adventurer can perform on their turn.

- **[Move](/docs/battles/adventurer-turn/move):** Move a number of [adjacent](/docs/glossary/adjacent) hexes up to the value of your [Stamina](/docs/adventurer/stats/stamina) stat.
- **[Engage](/docs/battles/adventurer-turn/engage):** Any number of times per turn, roll a number of available skill dice up to your [Stamina](/docs/adventurer/stats/stamina) or [Magicka](/docs/adventurer/stats/magicka) stat, as appropriate for each skill.
  - After your first engage action each turn, you must gain 1 light [fatigue](/docs/glossary/fatigue) each time you perform an additional engage action (if playing on [Expert](/docs/campaign/difficulty-levels/expert) difficulty, gain 2 light fatigue instead). Otherwise, there is no limit to the number of engage actions you can perform.
- **[Class Ability](/docs/battles/adventurer-turn/class-ability):** Any number of times per turn, spend the required amount of [tenacity](/docs/glossary/tenacity) to trigger a class ability.
  - Each non-[enduring](/docs/glossary/enduring) class ability must be triggered at its correct timing and can be triggered only once per turn.
- **[Explore](/docs/battles/adventurer-turn/explore) (delve only):** Once per turn, explore a hex from a distance up to your [Stamina](/docs/adventurer/stats/stamina).

### 4. End of Turn

Trigger any abilities with this timing. Then, proceed to the next adventurer or enemy in turn order.

**Resolving Partial Skills and Abilities**

When you resolve a skill or ability, you must do as much of the skill or ability as is possible, ignoring any portion that you are unable to resolve. If the skill or ability has a cost associated with it, you must be able to fully resolve the cost in order to resolve the skill or ability. If a skill or ability is worded such that you must do one thing **to** do another, or do one thing **then** do another, the first portion of that skill or ability is considered to be the cost.

:::tip[FAQ]
**How are dice and damage resolved on your turn?**

During an engagement, resolve dice one at a time. But damage and damage prevention are pooled and applied to the affected enemy after you resolve the last die of the engage that deals damage to that enemy.

For dice that require a target, or for a unit to be targetable/adjacent/within range/within sight etc., the unit must be in the proper position at the time the die is resolved - not necessarily when the damage is applied.

For the sake of some skills and abilities (most notably, the enemy skill Dodge), you may need to determine which dice you are resolving, and how you are resolving them, before you begin to resolve any dice. This is explained in the rulebook on pg. 60 by breaking down the "Resolve the Roll" step into the following sub-steps: first, a) Determine the results to resolve, then b) Resolve abilities.
