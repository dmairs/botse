During your turn, you can take a number of actions, including moving, engaging, resolving class abilities, or exploring at a distance. When it is your adventurer's turn to act, follow the steps below:

## Turn Sequence

### 1. Start of Turn

Trigger any abilities with this timing.

### 2. Recovery

Remove a number of dice from your [cooldown track](/docs/glossary/cooldown-track) equal to your [Cooldown](/docs/adventurer/stats/cooldown) stat, starting with the die furthest to the left in the track. As you remove dice, slide remaining dice in the track toward the left side to close any empty slots. Each type of die is handled as described below:

- **Skills:** [Recover](/docs/glossary/recover) and place skill dice in the correct slots in your attribute rows.
- **Fatigue:** [Discard](/docs/glossary/discard) light [fatigue](/docs/glossary/fatigue). Remove overfatigue and replace them at the leftmost **open** position in the track.
- **Status Effects:** [Discard](/docs/glossary/discard) [status](/docs/glossary/status-effect) dice.

### 3. Adventurer Actions

Perform 1 or more of the below actions in any order you choose. You must resolve each action before you perform another action. Some actions prevent an adventurer from performing others, but there is no hard limit to the number of actions an adventurer can perform on their turn.

- **[Move](/docs/battles/adventurer-turn/move):** Move a number of [adjacent](/docs/glossary/adjacent) hexes up to the value of your [Stamina](/docs/adventurer/stats/stamina) stat.
- **[Engage](/docs/battles/adventurer-turn/engage):** Any number of times per turn, roll a number of available skill dice up to your [Stamina](/docs/adventurer/stats/stamina) or [Magicka](/docs/adventurer/stats/magicka) stat, as appropriate for each skill.
  - After your first engage action each turn, you must gain 1 light [fatigue](/docs/glossary/fatigue) each time you perform an additional engage action (if playing on [Expert](/docs/campaign/difficulty-levels/expert) difficulty, gain 2 light fatigue instead). Otherwise, there is no limit to the number of engage actions you can perform.
- **[Class Ability](/docs/battles/adventurer-turn/class-ability):** Any number of times per turn, spend the required amount of [tenacity](/docs/glossary/tenacity) to trigger a class ability.
  - Each non-[enduring](/docs/glossary/enduring) class ability must be triggered at its correct timing and can be triggered only once per turn.
- **[Explore](/docs/battles/adventurer-turn/explore) (delve only):** Once per turn, explore a hex from a distance up to your [Stamina](/docs/adventurer/stats/stamina).

### 4. End of Turn

Trigger any abilities with this timing. Then, proceed to the next adventurer or enemy in turn order.

**Resolving Partial Skills and Abilities**

When you resolve a skill or ability, you must do as much of the skill or ability as is possible, ignoring any portion that you are unable to resolve. If the skill or ability has a cost associated with it, you must be able to fully resolve the cost in order to resolve the skill or ability. If a skill or ability is worded such that you must do one thing **to** do another, or do one thing **then** do another, the first portion of that skill or ability is considered to be the cost.

:::tip[FAQ]
**How are dice and damage resolved on your turn?**

Dice are resolved one at a time in the order the player chooses. For dice that deal damage, pool all damage that would be dealt to each non-adventurer, and apply that damage after the last die dealing damage to that unit is resolved. If any rolled dice allow non-adventurers to prevent damage, also pool these dice when calculating damage taken. Any restrictions regarding which units a die can be resolved against (for example, if a result requires adjacency) are assessed at the time the die is resolved.

This replaces the b. point under Resolve the Roll on pg. 60 of the rulebook.

Damage dealt by adventurers is pooled when dealt to **enemies or companions**. Damage is is not pooled when dealt to adventurers.
