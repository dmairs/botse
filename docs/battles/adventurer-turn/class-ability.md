When an [adventurer](/docs/glossary/adventurer) performs this action, they spend the required amount of [tenacity](/docs/glossary/tenacity) to trigger a class ability. You may gain 1 light [fatigue](/docs/glossary/fatigue) to change [battle form](/docs/battle-forms) before resolving the ability. You can only trigger each non-[enduring](/docs/glossary/enduring) class ability once during each turn at its correct timing specified in its ability text.

Note that some class abilities are not actions. These class abilities have either the [Enduring](/docs/glossary/enduring) keyword and are ongoing or have the [Interrupt](/docs/glossary/interrupt) keyword and must be triggered at the time specified in the ability's text.

**Resolving Partial Skills and Abilities**

When you resolve a skill or ability, you must do as much of the skill or ability as is possible, ignoring any portion that you are unable to resolve. If the skill or ability has a cost associated with it, you must be able to fully resolve the cost in order to resolve the skill or ability. If a skill or ability is worded such that you must do one thing **to** do another, or do one thing **then** do another, the first portion of that skill or ability is considered to be the cost.

**Do I have to use an Enduring or Innate ability?**

Even if they do not use the word "may", innate abilities (from class sheets) as well as any "Enduring" class abilities, are optional. You are not forced to use them if you do not want to.

**When can class abilities be triggered?**

#### In Combat

Inside of combat, class abilities can only be triggered on your turn as an action. Exceptions to this timing will be prefaced with [Interrupt](/docs/glossary/interrupt) and provide the timing for the ability.

Aside from Interrupt abilities that specifically state they can, class actions cannot be used in the middle of another action, such as a move or engage.

#### Outside of Combat

Outside of combat, class abilities can be triggered at any time, as long as the ability makes sense to be triggered outside of combat and doesn't have timing specified.
