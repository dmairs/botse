A battle ends after the current [round](/docs/battles/battle-round) when any of the following occur:

- The [party](/docs/glossary/party) achieves the encounter's [objectives](/docs/battles/objectives/).
- The party [retreats](/docs/battles/retreat) from battle.
- All [adventurers](/docs/glossary/adventurer) are [defeated](/docs/glossary/defeated).

Since the battle ends after the current round in which 1 of these events occurs, the battle does not necessarily end immediately after the last enemy is defeated, even if the party has a [Conquer](/docs/battles/objectives/conquer) objective.

## End of Battle Cleanup

After a battle ends (whether successfully or not), follow the steps below and then proceed to the [Reward Phase](/docs/day/reward-phase).

1. Remove all remaining [bonus HP](/docs/glossary/bonus-hp) from each [adventurer's](/docs/glossary/adventurer) mat and any HP exceeding the adventurer's maximum. Then, place each adventurer's chip, with its remaining HP, back in the art area of their race sheet. If the party has permanent [companion](/docs/glossary/companion) units that can appear in later battles, place each companion's chip near an adventurer mat, removing all [status](/docs/glossary/status-effect) dice or excess HP from that chip.
2. Each adventurer removes and exhausts any remaining dice from their [active slots](/docs/glossary/active-slot). Then, they [recover](/docs/glossary/recover) all of their [drained](/docs/glossary/drained) skill dice. Note: Dice still in an adventurer's [cooldown track](/docs/glossary/cooldown-track) at the end of a battle remain there until the next battle or until they are removed by other means, such as during the [End of Day Phase](/docs/day/end-of-day-phase) or visiting a town's inn.
3. Disassemble the battle map.
   - Place [enemy](/docs/glossary/enemy) chips back into their correct draw bags and place [cache](/docs/glossary/cache) chips back in the supply.
   - Sort the map tiles by shape. If [delve](/docs/battles/types/delve) tiles were used, shuffle each shape facedown. Then place the tiles back in their area.
   - Gather the delve cards, setting aside any cards marked with "SP" or otherwise required by the Delve Feature section at the front of your provinceâ€™s gazetteer. Then, shuffle the Delve Deck and place it back in its area.

This cleanup procedure only occurs after a battle, not after a peaceful encounter.
