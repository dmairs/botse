The party resolves the encounter it triggered during the previous phase. Town encounters are resolved by taking actions in that town. Other encounters are resolved as described by their text, either in the gazetteer or on the overland card.

After resolving the encounter, determine its success before proceeding to the [Rewards Phase](/docs/day/reward-phase).

If the party triggered no encounter, it **skips** this phase.

## Resolving Encounters

Quest and overland encounters must be successfully completed to earn their [XP](/docs/glossary/xp) or other rewards. If an encounter allows the party to choose how to complete it, the party must choose 1 option. If the party does not meet the requirements for a choice, it cannot choose it.

Encounters have 2 outcome types: peaceful or battle. When an encounter appears on an overland card, its outcomes are indicated by an icon.

### Peaceful

A peaceful (<img src="/icons/peaceful-outcome.svg" alt="Peaceful Outcome Icon" class="icon-svg" />) outcome resolves the encounter without the players taking part in a battle. A peaceful encounter is automatically successful unless otherwise noted. If the party does not fulfill a peaceful encounter's requirements, the encounter is failed.

### Battle

A battle outcome is resolved on the battle map. There are 3 modes of battle: clashes (<img src="/icons/clash.svg" alt="Clash Icon" class="icon-svg" />), delves (<img src="/icons/delve.svg" alt="Delve Icon" class="icon-svg" />), and dungeons (which do not appear on overland cards and have no icon).

Quest encounters are described either in their province's gazetteer or on a side quest card and are triggered and resolved as their text specifies.

A battle encounter is successful if at least 1 adventurer remains undefeated on the battle map and the party has achieved the objective for that encounter. If the party does not achieve a battle's objective, the encounter is failed.

### Town

These encounters are described in the gazetteer and are triggered when the party ends its overland movement in a town or rolls a <img src="/icons/town.svg" alt="Town Icon" class="icon-svg" /> result on the unstable die while at an unstable landmark (see Traveling Caravans).

Some towns can become closed as a result of encounters or quests. When this happens, the party must note it in the campaign journal. While a town is closed, the party cannot move into that town's hex.

To resolve a town encounter, refer to the town's entry in the gazetteer and follow these steps:

#### 1. Check Town Effect

Resolve this effect if it is triggered at the start of the encounter.

Some town encounters have an effect section that can trigger an event before adventurers take their individual actions. This section of the town entry describes how it is triggered. Some town effects can only be resolved once during a session. If this is the case, that encounter will instruct the party to record the effects in its journal.

Some town effects offer multiple choices. If so, the party must choose **only 1** when it resolves that event.

#### 2. Reveal Trainer and Shop

Most towns have a shop feature and a trainer feature, each of which has components that must be revealed.

##### Shop

Draw a number of common item (<img src="/icons/common-item.svg" alt="Common Item Icon" class="icon-svg" />) and legendary item (<img src="/icons/legendary-item.svg" alt="Legendary Item Icon" class="icon-svg" />) cards equal to the shop's values for each type and place those cards faceup. Items not taken from the shop are discarded at the end of the town encounter.

##### Trainer

Draw the number of skill line tokens specified in the gazetteer entry from the trainer bag and place them within reach of all players. If a trainer's constellation icon is faded out, set aside any skill line token of that constellation that is drawn and redraw another, returning the set-aside tokens to the bag when done. Tokens not taken from the trainer are returned to the trainer bag at the end of the town encounter.

#### 3. Complete Side Quests

If the party has side quest cards that can be completed during a town encounter, gain those quests' rewards and discard those cards now.

#### 4. Town Actions

Each adventurer may take up to 2 actions during a town encounterâ€”representing the resources provided by your guild to purchase services and supplies in towns. For each action, an adventurer can use 1 of the town's features, which are shown in the gazetteer, or use the guild town action on the party's guild card.

There are 2 types of action:

##### Personal Actions

These actions are chosen individually and can be resolved simultaneously with those of other adventurers. Using a town feature is a personal action unless otherwise noted. An adventurer can spend multiple actions to use the same town feature during an encounter, except the town square, which each adventurer can choose once per town encounter.

##### Group Actions

These actions must be taken cooperatively and appear with the word "group" after their name (some quest steps also require the party to take a group town action). Each adventurer must contribute 1 of their town actions towards a group action.

### Traveling Caravans

Adventurers may sometimes encounter traveling caravans in the wilderness of Tamriel, especially at unstable landmarks (<img src="/icons/unstable-landmark.svg" alt="Unstable Landmark Icon" class="icon-svg" />). Each province has a caravan entry in its gazetteer. When the party encounters a caravan, it is resolved as a town encounter using that entry.
